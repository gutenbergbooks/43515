<div class='chaptertitle'>INTRODUCTION.</div>


<p>While, in consequence of the development of electrical
invention and improvement, visual signaling
will be less frequently resorted to in future than heretofore
in the service of field lines of information, it
should be appreciated that the necessity for an adequate
supply of apparatus of this kind, and the need
for skilled manipulators to operate it, has in no wise
diminished. The great celerity with which electric
signals can be exchanged and their usual entire independence
of local conditions has placed systems of
this class foremost among the signaling methods of
the world. There is scarcely any commercial industry
whose successful existence does not vitally depend
upon some one, perhaps several systems of signaling,
and improvements of old and inventions of new signal
devices are continually necessary to meet the requisite
needs demanded by the progress of art and science.
Railways are probably the greatest of all commercial
users of signals. With them the great mass of intelligence
is transmitted by the electric telegraph and telephone,
but the flag, the semaphore, the signal light,
and many other contrivances furnish indispensable
visual adjuncts. Visual signaling is and always will
be a most valuable means of transmitting information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in peace and war, and it is not to be imagined that
it will ever be supplanted in its particular function by
the introduction of other methods. Occasions will
frequently occur in the field when no other means
will be practicable, and then, if not before, will the
value of the system be fully emphasized.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, a visual signal is any visible sign
by which intelligence is communicated, but in a military
sense the term visual signaling has a broader
meaning and includes other methods of transmitting
information than those which appeal to the sense of
sight.</p>

<p>In most systems of signals suitable for military use,
each signal is composed of one or more separate units,
known as elements. Having prescribed a certain
number of elements, the various signals are formed by
having these elements appear singly or together in
different arrangements or combinations. The continental
system is one of two elements, namely the dot
and the dash, while the Morse system employs three
elements, the dot, the dash, and the space. Having
agreed upon a certain number of combinations of
elements, a system of signals is formed by giving a
meaning to each combination. These meanings usually
include the letters of the alphabet and numerals,
combinations of which being used to formulate necessary
information. Combinations of elements of any
system can also, however, be used to indicate any
desired meaning.</p>

<p>With reference to period of visibility, signals are of
two kinds, transient and permanent. A transient
signal is one which disappears as soon as completed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
a permanent signal is one that remains in view for
some time. Heliograph signals are transient signals,
while signals made by code flags are permanent signals.
Signals are divided into classes in accordance
with the number of elements employed in their formation.
Thus, signals using two elements are signals of
the second class, signals using three elements signals
of the third class, etc.</p>

<p>The standard apparatus used in visual signaling is
fully described in a succeeding chapter. Some of the
instruments employed are used wholly for day, and
some wholly for night, signaling. Some devices, either
with or without slight variations, are equally well
adapted to day or night work. Visual signaling presents
a great field for ingenious and resourceful work,
and emergency will often demand the advantageous
employment of other methods than those described
herein.</p>

<h3>THE WAND.</h3>

<p>The wand is a stick of light wood about 18 inches
long and one-half inch in diameter. It is held loosely
between the thumb and forefinger and waved rapidly
to the right or left to indicate the elements of the
alphabet. It is used for practice purposes and the
signals made by it are only intended to be read at
very short distances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE FLAG KIT.</h3>

<p>Two kinds of flag kits, the 2-foot kit and the 4-foot
kit, are issued by the Signal Corps.</p>

<p><i>The 2-foot kit.</i>&mdash;This kit consists of one white and
one red signal flag, two three-jointed staffs, and a
suitable carrying case to contain the outfit. The
white flag is made of white muslin 2 feet square, with
an 8-inch turkey-red muslin center. The red flag is
of similar size and material, the only difference being
an alternation of colors in the body and center. The
means of attachment to the staff consists of a loop
at the center, and two ends of white tape at each edge,
of the back of the flag body. The staff is made of
hickory in three joints, each 23 inches long, and is
assembled by telescoping into brass ferrules. Brass
eyes are provided on the first and second joints to
receive the tape ends at the edge of the flag. The
carrying case, of convenient size and shape to contain
the two flags and staffs complete, is made of
8-ounce standard khaki bound with leather and fitted
with a shoulder strap.</p>

<p>The 2-foot kit is essentially a practice kit, although
under favorable conditions of weather and terrain it
may be used to advantage as a short distance service
signaling outfit. Two of these kits are issued to each
troop, battery, and company for the purpose of disseminating
general instruction in military signaling
throughout the army.</p>

<p><i>The 4-foot kit.</i>&mdash;This kit is of essentially the same
description as the 2-foot kit except as regards size.
The flags are 3 feet 9 inches square with 12-inch centers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and the staffs are considerably heavier, the joints
being each 36 inches long. The 4-foot kit is the standard
field flag kit and the range at which signals can be
exchanged with it depends on a variety of factors,
such as the condition of the weather, the location of
stations, the proficiency of signalmen, etc. The speed
for continuous signaling is seldom greater than five
to six words per minute.</p>

<p><i>Care of flag material.</i>&mdash;Signal flags should be examined
at the close of drill or practice and repairs
made to any rents or loose ties discovered. Flags,
when soiled, should be thoroughly washed and dried
in the sun. Signals made by clean flags are much more
easily read than those made by dirty ones. Staffs
should be handled with care, especially when jointing
or unjointing. Care should be taken not to bruise
the ends of the brass ferrules. If a ferrule becomes
loose on a staff it should be tightened without delay.</p>

<p><i>Powers and limitations of flag signaling.</i>&mdash;The advantages
which may be claimed for this method of
signaling are portability of apparatus, adaptability
to varied weather conditions, and great rapidity of
station establishment. The disadvantages are the
lack of celerity of the signals, their impenetrability
to dust or smoke, and the comparatively short ranges
at which they can be read.</p>


<h3>THE HELIOGRAPH.</h3>

<p>The heliograph is an instrument designed for the
purpose of transmitting signals by means of the sun's
rays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Historical.</i>&mdash;Experiments with the heliograph with
a view to its adoption as a part of the visual signaling
equipment of the United States Army were commenced
as early as 1878. The reported successful use
of the instrument by the British in India about this
time led to the importation of two heliographs of the
Mance pattern. A series of experiments with these
machines conducted for the purpose of eliminating
certain objectionable features finally resulted in the
evolution of the present type of service heliograph.</p>

<p>The early English heliograph was not provided with
a shutter, the flash being directed on the distant station
by means of a movable mirror controlled by a key.
The great objection to this type of instrument was the
impossibility of maintaining accurate adjustment during
the transmission of signals due to the fact that the
manipulation of the mirror tended to throw the flash
constantly out of alignment. To overcome this, the
American heliograph has been provided with a screen
designed to operate as a shutter and control the flash
reflected from an immobile mirror.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;The service heliograph equipment of
the Signal Corps consists of:</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;Heliograph assembled.</div>
</div>

<p>The mirrors are each 4&frac12;-inch squares of plate glass
supported by sheet brass and cardboard backings, and
mounted in brass retaining frames. At the center of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
each mirror there is an unsilvered spot three thirty-seconds
of an inch in diameter and holes corresponding
to these spots are drilled in the backing. The sun
mirror differs from the station mirror only in that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
has a paper disk pasted upon its face covering the
unsilvered spot. The mirror frames are carried by
brass supports provided at the bases with conical projections
accurately turned to fit the sockets of the mirror
bar and grooved at the ends to receive the clamping
spring. Each support is fitted
with a tangent screw and worm
wheel attachment functioned to
control the motion of the mirror
frame about its horizontal axis.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 182px;"><a id="Figure_2"></a>
<img src="images/i_017.jpg" width="182" height="471" alt="drawing carrying cases" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Mirror and mirror
bar case.</div>
</div>

<p>The mirror bar is a bronze
casting provided at the center
with a clamp threaded to fit the
screw of the tripod. By releasing
the clamp the bar may be
moved independently of the screw
and adjusted to any desired position.
Conical sockets for the reception
of the mirror supports are
provided at the ends of the mirror
bar. These sockets work freely in
the bar and, being actuated by a
tangent screw and worm wheel,
serve to regulate the motion of
the mirror frame about its vertical
axis. Clamp springs, for
engaging and securing the ends
of the mirror frame supports, are attached at each
end of the bar.</p>

<p>The screen is a brass frame 6&frac12; inches square, in
which six segments or leaves are mounted in such a
way as to form a shutter. The leaves are designed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
turn through arcs of 90&deg; on horizontal axes, unanimity
of movement being secured by connections made with
a common crank bar. The crank bar
is operated by a key and retractile
spring which serve to reveal and cut
off the flash. A set screw and check
nut at the lower edge of the screen
frame limits the motion of the crank
bar and the opening of the leaves.
A threaded base support furnishes
the means of attaching the screen
frame to the tripod.</p>

<p>The sighting rod is a brass rod 6&frac12;
inches long, carrying at the upper
end a front sight and a movable
disk. About the rod is fitted a movable
bronze collar, coned and grooved
to take the socket and clamping
spring of the mirror bar. A milled
edged bronze washer serves to clamp
the collar to the rod at any desired
point.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 113px;"><a id="Figure_3"></a>
<img src="images/i_018.jpg" width="113" height="512" alt="drawing carrying case" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Heliograph
tripods.</div>
</div>

<p>The tripods are similar in all respects,
the screw of either threading
into the mirror bar or screen frame.
Each tripod is provided with a hook
at the base of the head, allowing the
suspension of a weight when great
stability is required.</p>

<p><i>Assembling.</i>&mdash;There are two ways
of assembling the heliograph and the position of the
sun is the guide in determining which of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
should, in any given case, be employed. When the
sun is in front of the operator (that is, in front of a
plane through his position at right angles to the line
joining the stations) the sun mirror only is required;
with the sun in rear of this plane both mirrors should
be used. With one mirror the rays of the sun are
reflected directly from the sun mirror to the distant
station; with two mirrors, the rays are reflected from
the sun mirror to the station mirror, and thence to
the distant station.</p>

<p><i>With one mirror</i>: Firmly set one of the tripods
upon the ground; attach the mirror bar to the tripod;
insert and clamp in the sockets the sun mirror and
sighting rod, the latter having the disk turned down.
At a distance of about 6 inches, sight through the
center of the unsilvered spot in the mirror and turn
the mirror bar, raising or lowering the sighting rod
until the center of the mirror, the extreme point of
the sighting rod, and the distant station are accurately
in line. Firmly clamp the mirror bar to the tripod,
taking care not to disturb the alignment, and turn up
the disk of the sighting rod. The mirror is then
moved by means of the tangent screws until the
"shadow spot" falls upon the paper disk in the sighting
rod, after which the flash will be visible at the
distant station. The "shadow spot" is readily found
by holding a sheet of paper or the hand about 6 inches
in front of the mirror, and should be constantly kept
in view until located upon the disk. The screen is
attached to a tripod and established close to, and in
front of, the sighting disk, in such a way as to intercept
the flash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p><i>With two mirrors</i>: Firmly set one of the tripods on
the ground; clamp the mirror bar diagonally across
the line of vision to the distant station; clamp the
sun mirror facing the sun to one end of the mirror
bar and the station mirror facing the distant station.
Stooping down, the head near and in rear of the station
mirror, turn the sun mirror by means of its tangent
screws until the whole of the station mirror is
seen reflected in the sun mirror and the unsilvered
spot and the reflection of the paper disk accurately
cover each other. Still looking into the sun mirror,
adjust the station mirror by means of the tangent
screws until the reflection of the distant station is
brought exactly in line with the top of the reflection
of the disk and the top of the unsilvered spot of the
sun mirror; after this the station mirror must not be
touched. Now step behind the sun mirror and adjust
it by means of the tangent screws so that the "shadow
spot" falls upon the center of the paper disk on the
station mirror. The flash will then be visible at the
distant station. The screen and its tripod are established
as described in the single mirror assembling.</p>

<p><i>Alternate method with two mirrors</i>: Clamp the mirror
bar diagonally across the line of vision to the distant
station, with the sun mirror and the station mirror
approximately facing the sun and distant station,
respectively.</p>

<p>Look through small hole in sun mirror and turn the
station mirror on its vertical and horizontal axes until
the paper disk on the station mirror accurately covers
the distant station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Standing behind sun mirror, turn it on its horizontal
and vertical axes by means of the tangent
screw attachments until the shadow spot falls upon
the paper disk on station mirror.</p>

<p><i>Adjustment.</i>&mdash;Perfect adjustment is maintained only
by keeping the "shadow spot" uninterruptedly in
the center of the paper disk, and as this "spot" continually
changes its position with the apparent movement
of the sun, one signalman should be in constant
attendance on the tangent screws of the sun mirror.
Movement imparted by these screws to the mirror
does not disturb the alignment, as its center (the unsilvered
spot) is at the intersection of the axes of revolution.
Extra care bestowed upon preliminary adjustment
is repaid by increased brilliancy of flash.
With the alignment absolutely assured and the
"shadow spot" at the center of the disk, the axis of
the cone of reflected rays is coincident with the line
of sight and the distant station receives the greatest
intensity of light. Remember the distant observer
is unquestionably the better judge as to the character
of the flash received; and if therefore, adjustment is
called for when the "shadow spot" is at the center of
the disk, the alignment is probably at fault and
should be looked after at once. In setting up the
tripods always see that the legs have a sufficient
spread to give a secure base and on yielding soil press
firmly into the ground. Keep the head of the tripod
as nearly level as possible and in high wind ballast by
hanging a substantial weight to the hook. See that
the screen completely obscures the flash; also that
the flash passes entire when the screen is opened.
This feature of the adjustment is partially regulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
by the set screw attached to the screen frame. The
retractile spring should sharply return all the leaves
of the screen to their normal positions when the key
is released. Failure to respond promptly is obviated
by strengthening or replacing the spring.</p>

<p><i>Operation.</i>&mdash;It is of the utmost importance that
uniformity in mechanical movement of the screen be
cultivated, as lack of rhythm in the signals of the
sender entails "breaks" and delay on the part of the
receiver. Dark backgrounds should, when practicable,
be selected for heliograph stations, as the signals
can be most easily distinguished against them.</p>

<p>To find a distant station, its position being unknown,
reverse the catch holding the station mirror and with
the hand turn the mirror very slowly at the horizon
over the full azimuth distance in which the distant
station may possibly lie. This should be repeated
not less than twice, after which, within a reasonable
time, there being no response, the mirror will be
directed upon a point nearer the home station and
the same process repeated. With care and intelligence
it is quite probable that, a station being within
range and watching for signals from a distant station
with which it may be desired to exchange messages,
this method will rarely fail to find the sought-for
station.</p>

<p>The exact direction of either station searching for
the other being unknown, that station which first
perceives that it is being called will adjust its flash
upon the distant station to enable it when this light
is observed to make proper adjustments. If the position
of each station is known to the other, the station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
first ready for signaling will direct a steady flash upon
the distant station to enable the latter to see not only
that the first station is ready for work, but to enable
the distant station to adjust its flash upon the first
station.</p>

<p>Smoked or colored glasses are issued for the purpose
of relieving the strain on the eyes produced by reading
heliograph signals.</p>

<p><i>Care of apparatus.</i>&mdash;Minor parts of the instrument
should be dismounted only to effect repairs, for which
spare parts are furnished on requisition. Steel parts
should be kept oiled and free from rust. Tangent screws
and bearings should be frequently inspected for dust
or grit. Mirrors should invariably be wiped clean
before using. In case of accident to the sun mirror,
the station mirror can be made available for substitution
therefor by removing the paper disk. If the tripod
legs become loose at the head joints, tighten the
assembling screws with the screw-driver.</p>

<p><i>Powers and limitations of the heliograph.</i>&mdash;Portability,
great range, comparative rapidity of operation,
and the invisibility of the signals except to observers
located approximately on a right line joining the stations
between which communication is had, are some
of the advantages derived from using the heliograph
in visual signaling.</p>

<p>The principal disadvantage results from the entire
dependence of the instrument upon the presence of
sunlight. The normal working range of the heliograph
is about 30 miles, though instances of its having
attained ranges many times greater than this are of
record. The heliograph can be depended upon to
transmit from five to twelve words per minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE ACETYLENE LANTERN.</h3>

<p>The signal lantern is an instrument designed for the
purpose of transmitting signals by means of intermittent
flashes of artificial light. It is the standard night
visual signaling equipment furnished by the Signal
Corps and depends for its illumination upon the combustion
of acetylene gas.</p>

<p><i>Acetylene.</i>&mdash;Acetylene is a pure hydrocarbon gas,
producible in various ways, the commoner of which
are: (<i>a</i>) By dropping calcium carbide into water; (<i>b</i>)
by dropping water upon calcium carbide. This gas
gives, when burning, high penetrative power, and was
first described by Mr. Edmund Davy, professor of
chemistry to the Royal Dublin Society, in 1836.</p>

<p><i>Calcium carbide.</i>&mdash;In the manufacture of calcium
carbide for commercial purposes the best quality of
coke and quicklime are used. These two substances
are powdered thoroughly, mixed in proper proportions,
and then placed in an electrical furnace. Under the
action of the intense heat (5,500&deg; F.) these two refractory
substances unite and form calcium carbide. Calcium
carbide is of a grayish-white color, crystal in
appearance, and is nonexplosive and noncombustible,
being, except for its affinity for water, an absolutely
inert substance. A pound of commercial carbide will
produce approximately 5 cubic feet of gas. When
water is brought in contact with calcium carbide, the
generation of acetylene is rapid; owing to its strong
affinity for water it will become air slacked and slowly
lose its strength if exposed to the action of the moisture
in the atmosphere; consequently, when stored or
being transported it should be kept in air-tight cans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>When calcium carbide is brought in contact with
water, the following occurs:</p>

<p>As is known, the principal components of water are
oxygen and hydrogen, and calcium carbide is calcium
and carbon. When brought in contact, the oxygen in
the water decomposes the calcium in the carbide, and
in this decomposition the hydrogen in the water is
liberated and unites with the carbon of the carbide,
forming a hydrocarbon gas which is acetylene. It is
a pure white light of intense brilliancy and high candlepower.
The spectrum analysis of acetylene shows that
it is almost identical with sunlight, and in consequence
delicate shades of color appear according to their true
value as under the light of the sun, consequently it
penetrates fog to a greater distance than other lights.
Acetylene is like other gases&mdash;explosive when mixed
with air in proper proportions, confined, and ignited&mdash;and
the same precautions should therefore be taken in
its use as would be in the handling of coal or water
gas, gasoline vapor, etc. As acetylene is very rich in
carbon, it will not burn in its pure state without smoking.
To avoid this, burners have been constructed so
that the gas is mixed with the proper proportion of air
at the burner tip, to insure perfect combustion. The
burners for acetylene are different from those for other
gases. In order to get a flat flame, the gas is brought
through two perfectly round holes at an angle which
causes the two flames to impinge upon each other and
thus form a flat flame.</p>

<p><i>Method of gas generation.</i>&mdash;The method employed
for producing acetylene in the signal lantern is by
bringing water into contact with calcium carbide.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
The disadvantage of this method is that when the
water is not in excess and does not entirely surround
and touch each piece of carbide the heat of generation
will so change the chemical properties of the gas that
combustion at the burners is not satisfactory.</p>

<p>This change is technically known as "polymerization,"
or the breaking up of acetylene into other
hydrocarbons, such as vapors of benzine, benzole, etc.
These form a tarry substance which is apt to condense
at the burner tip and clog the openings. Also they
deposit carbon on the burners, as they require more
air for perfect combustion than does pure acetylene.
Another disadvantage of this system is that after the
carbide and water are in contact, generation of gas
will continue until all the water is absorbed. Where,
however, portability of the generating apparatus is
desired and resort to this method is necessary, the
objections are not important, if the apparatus is well
constructed and care is taken in its use.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;This equipment consists of a signal
lantern with cartridge generator attached. The lantern
is equipped with a special aplanatic lens mirror,
5 inches in diameter and about 3 inches focus. The
lantern is packed complete in a wooden case with
shoulder straps and the following extra parts are
included, each part having its own receptacle in the
case: 2 burners; 1 cover glass; 3 cartridges of calcium
carbide of 5 ounces each; 1 pair of gas pliers; 1 tube
white lead; 1 extra filter bag; 1 screw-driver.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;The signal lantern.</div>
</div>

<p>The lantern is made of brass, all parts of which are
riveted. The burner is of the double tip form, consuming
three-quarters of a cubic foot per hour. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
lantern is fitted with a hood to provide proper ventilation
and at the same time to prevent the flickering
of the light by the wind. The front door of the lantern
is hinged and
fastens with a
spring clasp; it is
so arranged that it
can be entirely removed
if necessary.
The cover glass is
made in three sections
and is not
affected by the expansion
and contraction
of the
metal due to
changes in temperature.
The glass is
fastened by the aid
of a spring wire,
so that it can be
readily removed if
it is necessary to
replace a broken
section. In the
base of the lantern
is a key and the
adjustment for regulating
the height
of the flame.
The key is so arranged that when not depressed but
little gas is admitted through the by-pass to the burner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and the flame is low. By depressing the key as much
gas as can be entirely consumed is admitted to the
burner, which gives a bright flash. At the back of
the lantern there is an adjustable handle, so that the
equipment can be used as a hand lantern if desired.
This form of lantern can be used with the regular
heliograph tripod, the generator being either attached
to the back of the lantern or suspended, as shown in
<a href="#Figure_4">figure 4</a>. When practicable it is better to attach the
generator to the lantern,
as shown in <a href="#Figure_5">figure 5</a>. The
candlepower of this lantern
is about 1,900.</p>

known as "the cartridge
generator," and while
constructed on the water-feed
principle, the disadvantages
incident to this
method are eliminated as
far as possible. It is constructed
of brass and has
a removable top. Attached
to the inside of
the top is a flexible frame with a spring latch, the
spring latch being hinged. (Fig. 8.) At the top of
the frame is a tube or cylinder, the bottom of which
is conical in shape and covered by a rubber plug. At
the bottom of the frame is a hollow tube, which is the
water inlet. The cartridge proper consists of a tin
cylinder, having an opening at either end. A small
cylinder of wire mesh extends from and connects these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
openings. The carbide lays around this mesh on the
inside of the cartridge. The rubber plug before mentioned
fits into the upper opening, and the water tube
into the lower opening. (See <a href="#Figure_7">figs. 7</a>, <a href="#Figure_8">8</a>, and <a href="#Figure_9">9</a>.) Inside
the tube, at the top of the frame, is a filter, the function
of which is to remove the dust and moisture from
the gas. The outlet from this chamber is by a brass
bent tube having a stopcock attached thereto.</p>

<p><a href="#Figure_6">Figure 6</a> gives a sectional view of the generator with
the cartridge in place. <i>D F G H</i> represent the valve
frame and <i>I</i> the cartridge attached. The reservoir <i>A</i>
is filled with water, and when the frame is immersed,
with the valve <i>R</i> closed, the air contained in the cartridge
and tubing can not escape, the water seal preventing,
while the confined air prevents the water
from rising in the tube <i>N</i>. When the valve at <i>R</i> is
opened and the air is allowed to escape, part of the
water from the reservoir rises into the tube <i>N</i> and then
out through the small hole <i>O</i> to the carbide. Gas is
immediately generated, the pressure of which prevents
further ingress of the water from the tube <i>N</i>, and the
generation of gas is suspended.</p>

<p>As the gas passes out through the valve at <i>R</i> the
pressure decreases, permitting the water to again rise
in the tube and flow through <i>O</i>. Gas is again generated,
which at once exerts its pressure and cuts off
the supply of water. This is the automatic action
by which water is brought in contact with the calcium
carbide. Thus it will be observed that the use or
escape of the gas regulates the generation by the simple
device of the rise and fall of a water column.
There is a cap <i>M</i> screwed over the tube <i>N</i>. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
used to deflect the course of the water downward, so
that the carbide in the lower part of the cartridge is
first attacked. There is a needle inside of cap <i>M</i>,
which can be used for cleaning the hole <i>O</i>. When the
gas is generated it passes through the filter <i>D</i> on its
way to the burner through <i>R</i>. This filter consists of a
tube loosely packed with ordinary nonabsorbent cotton,
which should never cover the escape pipe leading
to the valve <i>R</i>. In
passing through this
cotton filter moisture
and dust are removed
from the gas.
In the latest model
a felt filter is used
instead of cotton.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 380px;"><a id="Figure_6"></a>
<img src="images/i_030.jpg" width="380" height="455" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Signal lantern generator.</div>
</div>

<p>The escape pipe <i>F</i>
provides a means for
the escape of gas generated
and not used
or generated more
rapidly than consumed.
Should an
excess be generated,
it passes down
through the tube <i>F</i>, and, finding its way through some
small holes in the bottom of this tube, escapes through
the water seal and the opening at <i>C</i>. It will be
noted that if escaping gas at <i>C</i> should become accidentally
lighted, the flame can not strike back into
the filter and cartridge because of the water seal. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
principal things to observe in the operation of this
generator are the following:</p>

<p>(1) To see that the rubber plugs <i>fit tightly</i> into the
openings of the cartridge.</p>

<p>(2) That the tube <i>N</i>, the cap <i>M</i>, and water hole <i>O</i>
are not stopped up.</p>

<p>(3) That the cotton in the filter is changed frequently.</p>

<p>(4) That the <i>stopcock R is closed before inserting the
frame in the water</i>. If this latter instruction is not
complied with, it can be readily seen that the water
will have free access to the carbide and excessive
generation will occur.</p>

<p>When the charge is exhausted, the entire cartridge
is taken out and thrown away. This eliminates the
handling of carbide and the disagreeable task of cleaning
out the residuum after the gas has been extracted.</p>

<p>Connection is made from the stopcock <i>R</i> to the hose
connection on the lantern proper, and this is the passageway
of the gas from the generator to the burner.
As soon as the stopcock is opened the water rises
through the tube and flows to the carbide. The
advantage of the cartridge being submerged in the
water is to reduce and absorb as much of the heat
liberated by generation as is possible. These lanterns
have been tested up to a distance of 10 miles with the
naked eye, and under favorable conditions can be used
over a range somewhat in excess of this. With a
30-power telescope the flash can be read at a distance
of 30 miles.</p>

<p><i>Operation and care.</i>&mdash;Take the lamp and generator
from the case by aid of the handle attached to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
lamp; screw the complete outfit on a heliograph
tripod, or stand the outfit on a level object; remove
the cover of generator, to which is attached the flexible
frame (<a href="#Figure_9">fig. 9</a>); detach spring from the catch of
the flexible frame; tear off flaps from the ends of
carbide cartridge (or pry off small caps) and attach
the cartridge as shown in <a href="#Figure_9">figure 9</a>. Then attach to
frame as shown in <a href="#Figure_10">figure 10</a>, being careful to see that
both rubber plugs fit tightly into the holes in the
cartridge; fasten the latch of the spring over the metal
catch; close stopcock <i>R</i> on service pipe; completely
fill the outer can of generator with water, the object
being to have the generator level full of water when
the lamp is in service, then immerse the frame and
cartridge, pressing the top of the generator down
tight. In doing this the water will overflow the sides
of the generator tank. Now connect by rubber tubing
the stopcock with the gas inlet at the bottom of the
lamps, as shown in <a href="#Figure_4">figure 4</a>; then (1) open front door
of the lamp, (2) light a match, (3) open stopcock, and
(4) light the gas at the burner. In doing this hold
the key open. In the new model the key and hose
connection are on the side of bottom of lamp.</p>

<p>When the gas is ignited, the lamp is ready for signaling,
and the key can be operated as is the Morse
telegraph instrument, but of course not so rapidly.</p>

<p>In the event of the flame being too high when the
key is closed, adjustment can be made by loosening
the set screw (<a href="#Figure_4">fig. 4</a>, indicated by an arrow) and adjusting
the light by turning screw <i>b</i>. When at the proper
height, tighten the set screw which locks the by-pass
in its proper position. In the new model this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
accomplished by aid of the regulator by-pass valve at
the left-hand side of bottom of lamp. The lamp is
properly adjusted when shipped and should not be
changed unless absolutely necessary. Connect the
rubber tube to the burner before opening the stopcock
on the generator.</p>

<p>To recharge the generator, take the frame and the
old cartridge from the case, throw away the old case
and replace with a fresh one, proceeding as before.
See that fresh water
is put in the generator
each time a new
cartridge is used.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 351px;"><a id="Figure_7"></a>
<img src="images/i_033.jpg" width="351" height="386" alt="photograph" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In the tube
through which the
service pipe passes is
a felt filter for taking
the dust out of the
gas. If the filter
clogs, unscrew the
cap to which the
service pipe is attached,
clean the
felt, or replace it
with a new filter, binding it in place by a stout thread
or string.</p>

<p>If the burner of the lamp does not produce a perfectly
flat flame it has become clogged and should be
cleaned with the burner cleaner furnished, or a new
burner should be substituted, care being taken to put
a little white lead on the nipple, if practicable, so as to
insure a tight joint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>In repacking the outfit in the case, throw out the
water and wipe the can and generator parts dry. You
can not be too careful to
keep the apparatus clean.
This is especially true of
the small pipe that passes
up through the bottom of
the cartridge, with a cap
over it. The cap should
always be screwed in
place, as its object is to
prevent the water from
squirting to the top of
the cartridge.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 291px;"><a id="Figure_8"></a>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The back of the lamp
can be removed by turning
the small thumbscrew
on the top and drawing out the pin which holds the
shell into which is fitted the lens. It is not necessary
to take the back out except to replace a lens, as the latter
can be cleaned by opening the front door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>If it is desirable to use the lamp as a hand lantern
the flame can be turned on full by turning the button
in a vertical position; this locks the key open. In
the new model depress the key and lock it with the
latch above the key.</p>

<p>One charge of calcium carbide will supply gas to
burn about one hour with the light turned on full, or
for approximately three hours' signaling.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 436px;"><a id="Figure_10"></a>
<img src="images/i_035.jpg" width="436" height="360" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span></div>
</div>

<p>If signaling is to be suspended for some hours, empty
the water out of the generator and close valve <i>R</i>.</p>

<p>The glass front can be replaced by taking out the
wire spring. The glass cuts should be mounted in a
horizontal position and, to prevent breaking, should
be protected from rain when the lamp is hot. If a
glass should be broken and an extra one is not available
to replace it, signaling can be continued by turning
the flame on full and using the heliograph shutter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
a cap or piece of board in front of the lantern to
obscure and reveal the flash. Without the protection
of the cover the flame is easily blown out when turned
low, but will not be extinguished even in a strong
wind if the gas is turned full on.</p>

<p>Old model lamps are serially numbered from 1 to
200, inclusive; the new model lamps are serially numbered
from 201 upward.</p>

<p><i>Powers and limitations of the acetylene signal lantern.</i>&mdash;As
conditions are usually more uniform at night
than in the daytime, the signal lantern is probably the
most reliable of all visual signaling outfits. The
advantages of this form of apparatus are its portability,
speed of operation, and comparatively great
range. The principal disadvantages are due to the
interference caused by rain, fog, and moonlight. The
speed attainable with the lantern is about the same as
that attainable with the heliograph.</p>


<h3>ROCKETS AND SHELLS.</h3>

<p>Two distinct kinds of rockets and shells are issued,
one of which is adapted to day and the other to night
signaling. Shells and rockets of the amber smoke
type with parachutes are used in the daytime, while
shells (red and white) and sequence rockets are used
at night.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 450px;"><a id="Figure_11"></a>
<img src="images/i_037.jpg" width="450" height="756" alt="photograph" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;Signaling rocket and accessories.</div>
</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 378px;"><a id="Figure_12"></a>
<img src="images/i_038.jpg" width="378" height="600" alt="photograph" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>&mdash;Signaling shells.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;The shells are all single shot and are
fired from a 5-inch portable mortar, attaining a height
of about 550 feet. The report of explosion can be
heard at varying distances up to 5 miles, depending
on weather conditions. The parachute attached to
the smoke shell suspends a small light wooden tube<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a><br /><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a><br /><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
which, after ignition, emits smoke for from four to
six seconds. The red and white shells, on bursting,
discharge a shower of red and white fire which can
be observed for some time, in fact almost until the
sparks fall to the ground.</p>

<p>Rockets for both day and night signaling are
equipped with parachutes. The smoke rocket is of
similar construction to the smoke shell. The sequence
rocket is so arranged at the base that threaded sections
of combustible material burning either red or white
can be attached to it. Rockets ascend about 700
feet.</p>

<p>Each rocket and shell is supplied in a cylindrical
sealed tin can, which also contains a port fire, wind
matches, and for the rockets a stick in four sections.
On the outside of the can is a label designating the
kind of shell or rocket therein contained. These cans
are easily opened by pulling a ring and require no
special opening tool.</p>

<p><i>Operation.</i>&mdash;In firing shells the mortar should be
surrounded by earth or sand, preferably placed in
sacks. The fuse for all shells is very rapid and should
be ignited by attaching the port fire to a long stick.</p>

<p>All of the old type Signal Corps mortars, originally
designed to withstand a pressure of 1,000 pounds per
square inch, and made of ordinary iron pipe, are considered
unsafe and should be immediately destroyed.
The new mortars, recently made for the Signal Corps
by the Ordnance Department, are of cold-drawn steel
having a tensile strength of 6,000 pounds per square
inch, which is more than the maximum pressure for
firing any of the Signal Corps bombs. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
stamped "Signal Corps, U. S. A., Model 1907," or
"Rocket Gun, Watertown Arsenal, 1907."</p>

<p>The sequence rocket is prepared for use by attaching
red or white sections to the base in such a combination
as to form letters of the alphabet which it is desired
to use. Letters containing the same color in
sequence are very difficult to read and should be
avoided whenever possible. If necessary to use them,
blank sections furnished for the purpose should be
inserted between the units. The base of the rocket
will secure six units.</p>

<p>When rockets are to be fired the sticks must be
firmly attached, the rocket placed upright in a trough,
upon a frame, or against a post. If the fuse is beneath
the paper covering the "choke" orifice, the paper
should be torn off and the rocket ignited by a port
fire. In the rockets now used the fuse extends
through the covering and can be lighted direct. If
the night be damp this fuse should be exposed only a
moment before the rocket is fired. If several rockets
are to be fired in succession it is well to prepare them
all at the same time, and to have them all stood upright,
but each separated from the other at a distance
of at least 6 feet, else one may ignite the other
accidentally. In firing for chronosemic signals, one
rocket ought to be kept ready upon the frame and in
reserve, to be fired in place of one that fails.</p>

<p>If a rocket misses fire it is to be taken from the stand
and laid on the ground. Its place is at once supplied
by a similar rocket, fired in its stead. The failing
rocket is laid on the ground pointed away from the
station in order that if it has only hung fire and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
should afterwards ignite it may not disarrange the
signal shown or injure any one of the party. If the
wind blows freshly the rocket to be fired should be
inclined slightly against the wind.</p>

<p>Signal rockets and shells are furnished in sealed
cans and should not be removed therefrom until
ready for use. Strict economy should be observed in
the use of these articles and on no account should they
be used for purposes of display.</p>

<p><i>Employment.</i>&mdash;Rockets and shells are especially
valuable in making preconcerted or emergency signals.
On account of the great amount of ammunition required
it is impracticable to spell out messages with
them. These articles should be supplied to outposts,
detached stations, etc., to be used for signaling the
approach of the enemy or the happening of unexpected
events, the necessity for promptly knowing
which is important.</p>


<h3>THE SEMAPHORE.</h3>

<p>If signal stations are to be permanently occupied, and
it is impracticable to electrically connect them, communication
may be facilitated by erecting semaphores.</p>

<p>Semaphores, while primarily used for day signaling,
can be advantageously used at night by attaching
lights to the arms.</p>

<p>The navy semaphore consists of four arms pivoted
at the ends, three on one side of the upright, or pole,
and one on the other side. These arms have three
positions: Horizontal; upward at an angle of 45&deg; to
the horizontal; downward at an angle of 45&deg; to the
horizontal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Full instructions for the operation of the semaphore,
and also for the use of balls, cones, drums, pennants,
and whefts as distant signals, are given in the International
Code of Signals.</p>


<h3>THE SEARCHLIGHT.</h3>

<p>The electric searchlight, when available, can often
be successfully employed for night signaling, frequently
affording efficient means of communication between
ships and shore stations, when wireless working is
impracticable. This system of visual signaling is
practicable and especially valuable where the stations
are, on account of the terrain, not intervisible.</p>

<p><i>Methods of employment.</i>&mdash;In signaling with the
searchlight the usual method of handling the shaft
or beam is identical with that employed with the flag.
In the first position the beam is shown vertically,
while motions to the right, the left, and directly
serve to indicate the elements of the alphabet. Chronosemic
signals may also be used in searchlight signaling,
the shaft of light being directed intermittently
on some conspicuous object, such as a cloud, balloon,
or high mountain top.</p>


<h3>COSTON SIGNALS.</h3>

<p>These signals are pyrotechnic compositions which
burn with great intensity of light and color. The
colors red, white, and green are found best suited
for signaling. The signals are prepared in the form
of cartridges and are burned from a holder. The
colors burned may indicate the elements of any
alphabet, or such other special signals as may be
desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>


<h3>VERY'S NIGHT SIGNALS.</h3>

<p>The Very system employs projected red, white, and
green stars, which are shot from pistols held in the
hand.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;The Very pistol is a breechloading,
single-shot pistol with an 8-inch steel barrel chambered
to receive a 12-gauge commercial shotgun
shell. Brass shells are used and are packed in boxes
colored to indicate the character of stars employed
in loading. The color of the star fired may indicate
an element of any alphabet or any special signal which
may be desired. The stars rise to a height of about
200 feet and remain visible for some time.</p>


<h3>THE ARDOIS SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>The Ardois system is a special system of night signaling
designed to utilize combinations of red and
white signal lights in forming the elements of any
desired alphabet. Four signal lamps capable of displaying
either red or white lights are attached at
convenient intervals to a vertical cable or staff rigged
between the top of a mast and the deck, if on shipboard,
or the ground, if on shore. Illumination is
furnished by electrical means and any desired combination
of lights is automatically obtainable by operating
a keyboard.</p>

<p>This system is valuable on vessels or at permanent
shore stations, but the great expense of installation
precludes its general use. Wiring diagrams and
technical instructions relative to this apparatus are
in all cases furnished when the same is issued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>


<h3>SOUND SIGNALS.</h3>

<p>When recourse to any method of sight signals can
not be had on account of weather conditions or lack
of suitable apparatus, sound signals may often be
advantageously used. The commoner means of furnishing
sound signals are the horn and the whistle,
though many other kinds of apparatus are practicable.
The necessary elements of any system can
be indicated by one short, two shorts, and a long
blast. The advantage of this system of signaling is
that it can be used in any kind of weather, both in daytime
and at night. On the other hand, sound signals
are generally more difficult to read than sight signals
and tend to disclose the presence of stations to hostile
forces.</p>


<h3>IMPROVISED SIGNALING METHODS.</h3>

<p>The object of this chapter has been to describe only
the standard visual signaling equipment issued and
generally utilized. Besides the methods detailed,
there are many others which may be successfully employed
by the ingenious signalman when the necessity
for them arise. The use of any means of transmitting
signals whatever is justifiable when for any reason the
regular apparatus is not available. Special conventional
scout signals are given in paragraph 82, Field
Service Regulations.</p>

<p>In the field many instances will occur where it will
be necessary to transmit information rapidly without
recourse to the authorized equipment. This will be
especially true of outposts, detached stations, patrols,
and other small bodies of troops, and it will devolve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
upon individual commanders to improvise methods
of signaling best suited to the occasion and the conveniences
at hand.</p>

<p>Although the use of but one alphabet is authorized
in visual signaling in the U. S. Army, emergencies
may arise where it may be imperative to use either
the Army and Navy, the Continental Morse, or the
American Morse alphabet. Instructions for the use
of either alphabet under such conditions are given.</p>


<h3>EXECUTION OF SIGNAL ALPHABETS.</h3>

<div class="center">THE ARMY AND NAVY ALPHABET.<br />
<br />
SIGNALING WITH FLAG OR TORCH, HAND LANTERN, BEAM OF
SEARCHLIGHT, AND HELIOGRAPH.
</div>
<p>There is one position and three motions. The
position is with the flag or other appliance held vertically,
the signalman facing directly toward the station
with which it is desired to communicate, his body
erect and feet sufficiently separated to insure stable
equilibrium. The first motion ("one" or "1") is to
the right of the sender, and will embrace an arc of
90&deg;, starting with the vertical and returning to it, and
will be made in a plane at right angles to the line connecting
the two stations. The second motion ("two"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
or "2") is a similar motion to the left of the sender.
The third motion ("front," "three," or "3") is
downward directly in front of the sender and instantly
returned upward to the first position.</p>

<p>The beam of searchlight will be ordinarily used
exactly as the flag, the first position being a vertical
one.</p>

<p>To use the torch or hand lantern, a footlight must
be used as a point of reference to the motion. The
lantern is more conveniently swung out upward to
the right of the footlight for "1," to the left for "2,"
and raised vertically for "3."</p>

<p>In using the heliograph, the first position is to
turn a steady flash on the receiving station. The
signals are made by short and long flashes. Use short
flashes for "1," two short flashes in quick succession
for "2," and a long, steady flash for "3." The elements
for a letter should be slightly longer than in
sound signals.</p>

<p>Each word, abbreviation, or conventional signal is
followed by "3."</p>

<p>The full address of a message is considered as one
sentence and will be followed by the signal "33."</p>

<p>The signal to indicate that "cipher follows" and
"cipher ends" is with the flag and torch "XC3," and
with other methods, except the International Code,
by "XC." It will always precede and follow a cipher
message or such part of a plain text message as is
enciphered.</p>

<p>The following conventional signals are authorized
in the use of the army and navy alphabet:</p>

<h3>THE MORSE ALPHABETS.</h3>

<div class="center">TO SIGNAL WITH THE FLAG, TORCH, HAND LANTERN, OR BEAM OF
SEARCHLIGHT.</div>

<p>The dot is made by a motion to the right of the
sender embracing an arc of 90&deg;, starting from the vertical
and returning to it, in a plane at right angles to
the line connecting the two stations.</p>

<p>The dash is made by a similar motion to the left.</p>

<p>The space which occurs only between dots is made
by prolonging the signal for the last dot for an interval
of time equal to the time of an additional dot, the
staff of the flag, the beam of the searchlight, etc.,
being maintained in a horizontal position for the time
specified. The signal so made would therefore represent
a dot and space.</p>

<p>The letter "C" is accordingly made thus: Right,
right prolonged, right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The long dash ("L") is distinguished from the short
dash ("t") by prolonging the signal to the left for a
period of time equal to one dot. The long dash representing
"naught" is similarly made by prolonging
the signal to the left for a period of time equal to two
dots.</p>

<p>The "front" signal is made by lowering the flag
from the vertical position to the front and immediately
returning it to the vertical position.</p>

<p>A slight pause is made between each signal.</p>

<p>The following conventional signals are authorized,
using the Morse alphabets:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="more codes">

<tr><td align="left">End of message</td><td align="left">three fronts.</td></tr>
</table></div>



<h3>TO SIGNAL WITH THE HELIOGRAPH OR FLASH LANTERN.</h3>

<p>The dot is made by pressing down the key of the
shutter and immediately releasing the same.</p>

<p>The short dash is made by pressing down the key
and holding it down for a period equal to two dots.</p>

<p>The long dash ("L") is made by holding down the
key for a period equal to three dots while the longer
dash (naught) requires the key to be held down for a
period equal to four dots.</p>

<p>The space is made on the heliograph as in ordinary
telegraphy by the absence of any signals for a period
equal to the time of one dot.</p>

<p>On the heliograph the letter "C" is made as follows:
Short flash, short flash, interval, short flash.</p>

</div>

<p>When the call of a station is acknowledged, both
stations will adjust each on the flash of the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
When adjustments are satisfactory, the station called
will acknowledge and cut off its flash, and the calling
station will proceed with its message.</p>


<h3>INTERNATIONAL CODE OF SIGNALS.</h3>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;By means of the International Code of
Signals people of different nationalities may communicate
with each other, although neither party has knowledge
of any language save his own native language.
The code is, as its name indicates, international, and
every seagoing vessel of every nation is equipped
with its flags. The Code of Signals contemplates
the use of 26 flags (<a href="#Figure_14">figs. 14</a> and <a href="#Figure_15">15</a>); one for each letter
of the alphabet and a code pennant. Complete
instructions relative to the use of this code are contained
in a book issued by the Hydrographic Office,
Navy Department, and known as the "The International
Code of Signals." In using this system the signals
are displayed by hoisting combinations of two,
three, or four flags. All possible combinations represent
words, expressions, or phrases, which may be
found in the "International Code of Signals," referred
to above.</p>

<p><i>Two-arm semaphore.</i>&mdash;This system is frequently
used by the United States Navy, the following instructions
covering the use of the system:</p>

<p>1. To communicate with a station:</p>

<p>Face the station and wave the flags over the head
to attract attention, making at frequent intervals the
call letter of the station. When the station called
is ready to receive the message, it answers by displaying
its own call letter until the sender makes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
"alphabetical" or "numeral," as the case may be.
Then proceed with the message. At the end of each
word bring the flags across the lower part of the body.</p>

<p>2. To call a ship:</p>

<p>Hoist International Code letter J and make code letter
of ship; then proceed as in article 1.</p>

<p>3. To make a general semaphore signal:</p>

<p>Hoist cornet; all ships answer by answering pennant;
then make signal.</p>

<p>4. At the end of the message extend the arms horizontally
and wave the flags until the receiver answers
in the same manner, showing that the message is
understood.</p>

<p>Should the receiver miss a word, he signifies the fact
by waving the flag over his head. The sender will
then cease signaling and wave his flags similarly to
show that he understands. The receiver then makes
"repeat last word," or whatever he wishes to say.</p>

<p>Should the sender make a mistake, he will make
the "error" signal until answered by the receiver
with the same signal. He then proceeds with the
message.</p>


<h3>THE ARDOIS SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>In using this system in connection with the Army
and Navy Code, the red lamp indicates "1" and the
white lamp "2." Four lamps are placed on a vertical
staff and electrically illuminated to indicate the
numerals of the Myer Code, which represents the
letters of the alphabet. For instance, white-white, or
"22," represents the letter "A," and white-red-red-white,
or "2112," represents the letter "B," etc. In
this system the lights indicating the letters of the
alphabet are read from the top downward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>When the lamps are placed horizontally, they are
read from the sender's right to his left, and consequently
from the receiver's left to his right.</p>

<p>When the letters of the alphabet are to be used to
indicate the meaning set opposite them in the following
tabulation, the upper light of the display is pulsated.
This is effected by means of a special pulsating
key. Special signification is not given "I" and "T,"
they being represented by a single lamp.</p>

<p>Before numerals are made, the distinctive signal for
"numerals" "X" is shown and the upper light is pulsated,
which serves still further to distinguish them
from letters. The resumption of letters after using
numerals will be indicated by the upper light being no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
longer pulsated, but the display "letters" ("3") will
be turned on as an additional indication.</p>

<p>The acknowledgment of the correct receipt of a
message will be indicated by the letter "R." If the
message has not been fully received, or if it is not
understood, indication thereof will be made by signaling
the letter "G."</p>

<p>The end of a word is indicated by 2212.</p>


<h3>COSTON SIGNALS.</h3>

<p>Letters of the army and navy alphabet may be
represented at night by Coston lights, port fires, or
other colored pyrotechnical lights by displaying the
"red" for one and the "white" for two.</p>

<p>In using the Morse alphabet the "red" represents
the dot and the "white" the dash.</p>

<p>Coston signals and other similar lights are best
suited for preconcerted signals.</p>


<h3>VERY'S NIGHT SIGNALS.</h3>

<p>The navy signal book is used, to which the following
explanation refers:</p>

<p>The letter R stands for red and the letter G for
green, and each letter designates a separate star or
cartridge. Bracketed stars are a pair of different
colors, discharged together from two pistols. The
system is based on the Army and Navy Code, red representing
"1" and green "2."</p>

<h3>ROCKET SIGNALING.</h3>

<p>In general, rockets and shells are best used in displaying
preconcerted signals.</p>

<p>Sequence rockets may also be used to display different
colored lights in sequence to represent letters or
numerals of the army and navy alphabet. The
method of attaching the sections in the base of the
sequence rocket is described in Chapter III. In using
sequence rockets in this manner, the element "1" of
the army and navy alphabet is represented by a red
star, while a white star represents the element "2."
To send the letter "A" a rocket showing two white
stars is sent up. If "B" is to be sent, a rocket showing
white-red-red-white is discharged. Each star<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
burns for four to six seconds, and there is a slight
interval between the visibility of each star. Between
two or more stars of the same color, as "A," "N,"
"D," "dummies," which show no light and carry the
fire to the next star to be ignited, are employed.</p>

<p>In the preparation of codes for signals with rockets
or bombs there should always be arranged a "preparatory
signal" which means "Are you ready?" etc., and
an "answering signal," which means "Repeat your
last signal," etc., a signal "annul," which means "Disregard
last signal," and a signal to signify the correct
receipt of the complete message, or "Signal seen and
understood."</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter IV.</span></h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE FIELD MESSAGE.</div>


<p><i>Definition.</i>&mdash;The term "field message" is applied to
all messages sent over field lines of information. All
field messages for transmission over field lines of information
by electrical or visual means should be plainly
written by the sender on the blank forms in the United
States Army Field Message Book. The practice of
verbally delivering telegrams to enlisted men for
transmission should invariably be discouraged.</p>

<p>"In framing telegrams, all words not important to
the sense will be omitted. The last name of the officer
addressed, or his title, and the last name of the sender
are generally sufficient." (Paragraph 1198, Army
Regulations.)</p>

<p><i>The blank form.</i>&mdash;The United States Army Field
Message Book issued by the Signal Corps is 4<small><sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub></small> inches
wide by 6&frac34; inches long, and contains 40 message blanks
with duplicate tissue sheets and two sheets of carbon
paper.</p>

<p>The message is written on the yellow sheet, which
can be torn out for delivery. The carbon sheet is
attached to the book, and contrary to the custom in
most carbon duplicating books, is placed <i>under</i> the
tissue sheet when a message is being written. When
not being used, the carbon sheet should invariably be
kept in the back of the book. When the upper carbon
sheet has become worn out, it should be torn out and
the second carbon sheet used instead. The blank
form is shown in <a href="#Figure_16">figure 16</a>. The back of the blank is
ruled in squares and provided with scales for use in
making sketches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Figure_16"></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Writing the message.</i>&mdash;In writing the message the
name of the sending detachment should appear after
the heading "from" on the upper line, as "from Headquarters
1st Brigade," while the location of the sender
should appear on the second line after the heading
"at." The heading "hour" on the third line should
show the hour the message was <i>written</i> and not the hour
the message was transmitted. The heading "received"
at the bottom of the page is filled in by the addressee and
shows the time of the receipt of the message by him.</p>


<h3>INSTRUCTIONS TO OPERATORS.</h3>

<p><i>Use of message blank.</i>&mdash;The field message blank will
be used for field messages both sent and received.</p>

<p><i>Duties of sending operators.</i>&mdash;The <i>sending</i> operator
will enter the time when the message is handed him
for transmission in the left-hand corner at the bottom
of the blank opposite the word "Received." He will
enter in the proper places, at the head of the blank, the
number of the message, the call letter of his station,
with his personal signal, the check (number of words
or groups of cipher contained in message, counting
address and signature), and, after "OK" has been
received, he will enter the time the message was sent,
and the call letter of the receiving station, with the
personal signal of the receiving operator.</p>

<p><i>Order of transmission.</i>&mdash;To transmit a message, the
operator will send: (1) The number of message and
call letter of his station; (2) his personal signal; (3)
the check; (4) "fm" followed by name of sending
detachment; (5) "at" followed by location of sending
detachment and date; (6) "Ho" followed by hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
(a. m. or p. m.) message was written; (7) address in
full; (8) period, (<b>-&nbsp;-&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;-&nbsp;-</b>); (9) body of message; (10)
"sig" (signature follows); (11) signature.</p>

<p><i>Duties of receiving operators.</i>&mdash;The <i>receiving</i> operator
will add to the message received, the month, date, and
year, and omit the "sig," "fm," and "at," and, after
satisfying himself that the check and number of words
correspond will give "OK" followed by the call letter
of his station and his own personal signal. He will
then enter in the proper places, at the head of the
blank, the call letter of his own station, with his personal
signal and the time the message was received.</p>

<p><i>Communications confidential.</i>&mdash;Communications
transmitted by telegraph or signals are always confidential
and will only be revealed to those officially
entitled to receive them.</p>

<p><i>Checking the message.</i>&mdash;In preparing the "check"
of the message, all words and figures written in the
address, body of the message, and the signature will
be counted.</p>

<p>In counting the check of a message, all words,
whether in plain English, code, or cipher, pronounceable
or unpronounceable, or initial letters, will be
counted each as one word. The abbreviations for the
names of places, cities, towns, villages, States, Territories,
and Provinces, will be counted as if written in
full. In the names of towns, counties, countries, or
States, all of the words will be counted.</p>

<p>Abbreviations of weights and measures in common
use, and cardinal points of the compass, will be
counted each as one word.</p>

<p>To prevent liability to error, numbers and amounts
should be written in words, and when not so written,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the receiving operator will request that it be done. If
the writer declines to write the amounts in words, the
message will be accepted as written, and each figure
will be counted as one word.</p>

<p>Figures, decimal points, and bars of division, and
letters will be counted each separately as one word.</p>

<p>In ordinal numbers, the affixes, st, d, nd, rd, and
th, will each be counted as one word.</p>

<p>In transmitting the telegram shown in <a href="#Figure_16">figure 16</a>, the
following would be sent by the operator:</p>

<div class='hang2'>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SIGNAL STATION.</div>


<h3>LOCATION OF STATIONS.</h3>

<p>In field operations tactical considerations will
usually prescribe within certain limits the number
and general location of signal stations. The general
directions for deployment being given, the signalman
will be called upon to demonstrate his skill in the
selection of particular locations most conducive to
the efficient service of information.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Figure_17"></a>
<img src="images/i_074.png" width="600" height="342" alt="drawing of signalling to many different points" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span>&mdash;Field signal station.</div>
</div>

<p><i>General considerations.</i>&mdash;Considering all things, the
best location for a signal station is one which affords
maximum visibility and at the same time minimum
exposure to hostile observation. These conditions,
apparently paradoxical, can be more or less reconciled
by the exercise of ingenuity on the part of the
signalist. A good theoretical knowledge of the special
requisites of signal sites, together with the ability to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a><br /><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
apply it to the conditions arising in any given case,
will result in securing the best obtainable locations.</p>

<p>The first essential of the signal station is visibility,
the second being that of concealment from hostile
observation. In acquiring a mean between conflicting
requirements, the following special considerations
in the selection of stations should be considered.</p>

<p><i>Backgrounds.</i>&mdash;Backgrounds are important factors
in the selection of signaling sites.</p>

<p>Sky backgrounds are desirable as affording strong
contrast and are therefore conducive to celerity in the
transmission of signals. They are rare and can only
be secured when stations are located on the exact crest
of ridges, on mountain peaks, or on lands which bound
the horizon of view from the other stations. Stations
with sky backgrounds, while affording the best facilities
for transmission, are little adapted to the requirement
of secrecy.</p>

<p>Dark backgrounds are far more common and more
easily obtainable than sky exposures. They afford
the maximum means of concealment from hostile
observation, but materially reduce the range, speed,
and accuracy of signal transmission.</p>

<p>Mixed or broken backgrounds are those which display
varied colors behind the signals. Backgrounds
of this description do not accord with either of the
essential requirements of the signal station and should
be avoided whenever possible.</p>

<p>In general, sky backgrounds should always be
selected for signal stations when conditions are such
that the requirement of secrecy can be dispensed with;
if, on the other hand, there is reason to fear that the
signals may be intercepted by the enemy, dark backgrounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
should invariably be chosen, even though the
disadvantages they impose, render them less desirable
visually.</p>

<p><i>Azimuth of stations.</i>&mdash;The azimuth of signal stations
should, if possible, be such that the visual lines of
information should intersect the vertical plane through
the apparent course of the sun, at a considerable
angle. Stations located so as to be unavoidably
viewed from these directions during portions of the
day are very liable to appear enveloped in a haze, and
telescopes, if turned upon them, are filled with dazzling
light. If the location of stations on or close to the
sun line is unavoidable, sites affording sky exposures
should be chosen. Exposures of this kind obviate to
a great extent the difficulty of sun haze and should be
secured when this difficulty is encountered and it is
impracticable to change the azimuth of the station.</p>

<p><i>Altitude.</i>&mdash;The location of signal stations at high
altitudes will tend to obviate difficulties arising from
smoke, haze, and dust. The undulation of the atmosphere
noticeable on a hot summer's day is always less
at a distance from the earth's surface, and it is often
practicable to read signals from a tree or housetop
when they would be unintelligible from the ground.
This air undulation is less over spots well shaded than
those exposed to the glare of the sun, a fact that should
be borne in mind in all telescopic examinations.
Another reason for locating stations at high altitudes
is because the cool night air, the smoke and dust of the
day, and heavy mists lie close to the ground, filling the
depressions and lowlands, while the higher points
remain in view. Stations on high ground are then
equally well adapted to day and night signaling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Sites and selections of this kind of terrain will not only
often preclude the necessity for changes of location,
but also will allow the continuous working of the
station when signals made from lower positions would
be invisible. In foggy or murky weather peaks and
mountain tops are usually enveloped in mist, and
under these conditions stations should be situated on
lower ground.</p>

<p><i>Determination of background color.</i>&mdash;The color of the
background of a station is that color against which the
signals appear to be displayed when viewed from the
distant station. Having chosen a point entirely in
view of the station or stations to be communicated
with, and having fixed the exact position of the signaling
apparatus, the color of the background should be
determined as carefully as conditions of terrain will
permit. If the elevation of the distant station is
without doubt greater than that of the home station
it is safe to assume that the color of the background
will be that of the objects directly around and behind
it. On the other hand, if the distant station unquestionably
occupies the lower position, a sky exposure
will usually result. In locating stations it is very
difficult, if not impossible, especially at long ranges, to
determine the color of the background as viewed from
the distant station when the stations are approximately
on the same level. This can only be done by
proceeding in front of the home station and taking
such a position that it can be viewed with the eye on
the line of sight between the stations. The telescope
should be established over the initial point of the home
stations and directed on the distant station. The
observer for background should proceed to a point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
where his head is in the center of the field of the telescope.
Looking back at the home station from this
point, the color of the objects about and just behind
the initial point will be the color of the background.
The correct determination of background color from
the vicinity of home stations is usually difficult and
unsatisfactory, and it is considered the best method to
establish communication with the distant station by
simultaneously using several kinds of signaling apparatus,
that kind producing the most intelligible signals
being retained for continued use.</p>

<p><i>Choice of apparatus.</i>&mdash;Sunlight conditions permitting,
the heliograph will ordinarily be used for day
signaling on account of the advantages of the great
range and speed afforded by it. When its use is prohibited
by weather conditions, the flag will be substituted
for it. The white flag will be used against
dark and the red against sky or broken backgrounds.
The distant station is the better judge as to which
color flag is best suited to given conditions and the
color indicated by it should invariably be used. For
night signaling, the acetylene lantern is usually employed.
Long-range night signaling should be done
with the searchlight if available. The employment
of the semaphore, in daytime, and the Ardois system,
at night, will be confined to more or less permanent
stations. Rockets, shells, night fires, etc., are only
employed for special or emergency signals.</p>

<p><i>Miscellaneous considerations.</i>&mdash;For various reasons
stations should not be located at or near camp grounds.
These localities usually afford mixed backgrounds, and
the presence of dust and smoke and the interference
caused by moving bodies of troops and trains will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
militate against the efficient transmission of signals.
Stations located in vicinities of this kind are also subject
to annoyance from noise and visits of unauthorized
persons. Signal stations should be convenient for
messenger service and hence as near commonly traveled
roads as the physical contour of the country will
permit. Locations for signal stations should be so
selected that the visual lines do not cross traveled
roads, camps, etc., as dust and smoke in the daytime
and lights at night are factors in determining the visibility
of signals. Signal stations can if necessary be
artificially concealed by erecting screens constructed
of limbs of trees, etc., about the flanks and rear.
Sheltered positions should be utilized in windy weather.</p>

<p><i>Intervisibility table.</i>&mdash;The following table shows the
extent of horizon for different heights above the sea

</table></div>


<p>A formula to determine approximately the limits of
visibility from a given height is as follows: The square
root of the height of the station in feet multiplied by
1.26 equals the distance in miles at which the signal is
visible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence, an observer whose eye is 30 feet above the
sea can distinguish an object 7 miles distant, provided
it is at the sea level; but if the object is itself 15 feet
above the sea he can make it out 7 + 5 = 12 miles off.</p>


<h3>FINDING A STATION.</h3>

<p>To find a signalman near any known station, note
with the unaided eye some prominent landmark near
which the looked-for person or object is supposed to
be, and direct the telescope upon the place, as sight is
taken over a gun barrel, covering the object; if the
eye is now placed at the eyeglass of the telescope, the
prominent or directing landmark will be found in the
field of view. It will be easy then to scale the country
near the marker until the signalman is found. This
method is often necessary at night, when only a point
of light is seen far off through the darkness, and the
telescope must be turned upon it. When the compass
bearing of the object sought for is known, the telescope
may be aligned by a line drawn with the proper compass
bearing. Commencing then with the view at the
horizon, the telescope is slowly moved from side to
side, taking in fresh fields of view each time a little
nearer to the observer, until the whole country shall
have been observed from the horizon to quite near the
station. When the general direction only of the object
can be given and it is sought for, the whole landscape
in that direction to the horizon should be divided into
sections by imaginary lines, the limits of these sections
being bounded between visible landmarks through
which the bounding lines are supposed to pass. Each
section should be scrutinized little by little until the
glass has been passed over every spot. Such search
will seldom fail to be successful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The magnetic bearings of all stations with which
another station has worked should be carefully noted
and made matter of record in the office directly concerned,
so that advantageous use may be made of this
data. In addition, guide lines may be established by
driving two stakes firmly into the ground and close to
each other. A prolongation of a line through the
center of one post and marked on the adjacent one will
strike the distant station. Under each line should be
written the name of the station which it marks.</p>

<p>Signalers upon permanent or semipermanent stations
will examine, from time to time, every prominent
point within signal distance, to see if communication
is attempted therefrom.</p>

<p>Attempts to attract the attention of a known station,
in order to be successful, must be persistent.
They should never be abandoned until every device
has been exhausted, and they should be renewed and
continued at different hours of the day and night. It
must be remembered that efforts which have failed
because the observer's attention has been drawn in
another direction may at any other moment be successful
if the observing glass chances to bear on the
calling signals.</p>

<p>During the whole time that signals are being made
to attract attention the calling station must watch
closely with the telescope the station called. The
watch should not be relaxed until communication is
established or the station ordered abandoned.</p>

</div>


<h3>OPERATION OF STATIONS.</h3>

<p><i>Personnel.</i>&mdash;At signal stations where continued
operation is required at least a squad or "set of fours"
is required. Physical and mental exhaustion always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a><br /><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
result from continuous signal duty, and as alertness
of mind and body is an indispensable factor in the
prevention of errors, two reliefs of signalmen should
be furnished each station whenever practicable.
The senior officer or enlisted man is in charge of the
station and is responsible for efficiency and discipline.
He will require from each man a strict and entire
attention to his own immediate duties, and permit
no conversation that will distract the men at work.
He will be careful not to allow persons to loiter about
the station or within the hearing of the words called
out to the signaler. The assignment of men should
be such that a continuous watch for signals is kept
and the responsibility for neglect to promptly answer
calls determined. Of the station men, one is the
sender, whose duty it is to transmit all signals to contiguous
stations. Another, the receiver, attends the
telescope and reads and calls off the signals displayed
at the distant station. A third man acts as recorder,
alternately calling off the outgoing message to the
sender or transcribing the incoming message repeated
by the receiver.</p>

<p><i>Calls and personal signals.</i>&mdash;Each station will be
assigned a call consisting of one or two letters. Each
and every operator will also have a personal signal
of like character. Station calls or personal signals
when once given or assumed will not be changed
except by order of higher authority. Every station
should at all times have on hand a list of all calls and
personal signals liable to be encountered in station
working. The general call suited to attract the attention
of any station whose regular call is unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
will always be a signal represented by the letter "A"
in the Morse or the letter "E" of the Army and Navy
Code.</p>

<p><i>Opening communication.</i>&mdash;To open communication
with any distant station whose call is known, signal
the call repeatedly, occasionally signing the call of
the home station. If the regular call of the station
sought is unknown the general call above prescribed
should be used. As soon as the call is observed the
called station will acknowledge receipt by "ii ii," or
"I understand," signing thereafter its station call.
These preliminaries completed, the stations are ready
for working.</p>

<p>It is sometimes difficult to secure the attention
of stations at unexpected hours. The force may
not be strong enough for an uninterrupted watch.
To provide, so far as possible, for this contingency,
it may be concerted that if communication is required
at unusual time, or is of pressing importance, certain
flags shall be displayed, rockets discharged, smokes
shown, or other attention-compelling signals used.</p>

<p>When a number of stations are in view from one
station and it is desired to send a message to all or
more than one station, some preconcerted signal, as
a rocket, a red light, or some peculiar flag or torch
signal, should be designated as a signal for general
attention. Upon noticing this signal all the called
stations reply, and then observe the calling station.
This plan is useful when two or more stations can, at
the same time, read the signals from the one station,
and thus together receive any information to be
transmitted from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>When a signal station is to communicate with two
or more stations, a telescope should be firmly fixed
bearing on each, when practicable, and so far apart
that those communicating with one station will not
disturb the other party.</p>

<p><i>Commencing the message.</i>&mdash;Every message is invariably
commenced by the signal "Hr" or "Anr."
Sometimes at the commencement of communication
a preface will be sent in order to give some preparatory
information to the receiving station regarding the
number or character of messages about to be sent.
For example, "Hr 8," means "I have eight for you"
or "Hr ck 300" means a three hundred word message
follows.</p>

<p><i>Sending and receiving.</i>&mdash;Before the commencement
of a message, care should be taken that all the letters
and characters thereof are entirely and correctly
understood by the signalman whose duty it is to call
the same to the sending operator. The message is
read off by the "reader," who first calls off a word
and then spells it out letter by letter. The "reader"
should observe the signals of the operator and invite
his attention to any apparent errors. When the last
letter of a word is announced this fact will be communicated
to the sending operator.</p>

<p>At the receiving station the man at the telescope
will call off each letter as received and not wait until
the completion of a word. On reaching the end of
a word announcement of this fact will be made to the
recorder.</p>

<p><i>Breaking.</i>&mdash;If the sending operator discovers that
he has made an error which will probably render the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
sense of the message unintelligible at the receiving
station, he will make the signal "BK" and recommence
the message, beginning at the last word correctly
sent. When the receiving station fails for
any reason to get correctly what is being sent, the
sending station is interrupted by the signal "GA,"
followed by the last word correctly received. The
message will then be recommenced by the sending
station at the point indicated.</p>

<p><i>Discontinuance of transmission.</i>&mdash;When all the
messages on file at any station have been sent the
signal "NM" in Morse or "Cease signaling" in the
army and navy system, according to which code is
authorized, will be the concluding signal of the sending
station. When a signal station is operated only
during the daytime, the signal "GN" will be transmitted
after all business filed up to the hour designated
for closing has been dispatched.</p>

<p><i>Acknowledgment of receipt.</i>&mdash;No message will be
considered sent until receipt for the same has been
acknowledged. This is effected by making either the
"I understand" of the army and navy or the "OK"
of one of the Morse systems, depending upon the one
authorized. In every case the receiving operator's
signal is signed after acknowledgment. When a
number of messages are continuously sent, one
acknowledgment for all will suffice and will be so
understood. In receiving messages nothing should be
taken for granted and nothing considered as seen
until it has been positively and clearly in view.</p>

<p><i>Station records.</i>&mdash;Records kept at field signal stations
will be confined to original files of messages sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and carbon copies of messages received. Ordinarily
the only available stationery will be the United States
Army Field Message Book. Station records will be
invariably preserved as part of the station equipment
until orders for their disposition are given by higher
authority. Whenever a station is in imminent danger
of capture, all records should be destroyed in the discretion
and under the direction of the operator in
charge.</p>

<p><i>Formation of signals.</i>&mdash;Make signals with regularity;
do not send one word rapidly, the next slowly; adopt
such a rate of speed as can be read by the distant
signaler without causing him to "break" frequently.
Make a distinct pause between letters. It is time
gained to do so; it is a loss of time and an annoyance
to run letters together. Nothing so distinguishes the
good from the indifferent operator, visual or telegraph,
as this. When signals are being made with a flag, a
fraction of a second will be ample. In using the lantern
or heliograph, the pause between letters should
be relative to the time of display of the elements,
longer than with the flag. To prevent any entangling
of the flag upon its staff, skillful handling, acquired
by practice, is necessary. It is accomplished by making
a scoop of the flag against the wind, the movement
describing an elongated <a href="#Figure_8">figure 8</a>, thus &infin;. The motions
should be made so as to display in the lateral
waves the whole surface of the flag toward the point
of observation.</p>

<p>In using the heliograph, if the receiver sees that the
sender's mirror needs adjustment, he will turn on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
steady flash until answered by a steady flash. When
the adjustment is satisfactory, the receiver will cut
off his flash and the sender will resume his message.</p>

<p><i>Repeating the message.</i>&mdash;It may happen that very
important messages received by signals must be verified
by repeating back from the receiving station,
signal by signal, each signal used by the sending
station in conveying the message. There can be no
error in signals thus verified, and the correct transmission
of the message is made certain. For such
verification each signal must be repeated by the receiving
station as soon as it is made at the sending station.</p>

<p><i>Signal practice.</i>&mdash;Full efficiency of the signaler can
be maintained only through constant practice, and
those in charge of Signal Corps troops should see that
sufficient practice be had to insure that accuracy and
rapidity in handling messages which is so essential in
time of war.</p>

<p>Instruction should commence with the study of the
principles of signaling and the theories of their general
use, and the pupil should be well grounded in this
study before practice is begun. He should so memorize
the alphabets to be used that no letter combination
will require thought to determine its meaning.</p>

<p>Daily inspections should be made to insure that all
signaling instruments, appliances, and materials are in
readiness for instant use. Defects in the apparatus
annoy the sender; to a greater extent they annoy the
person to whom the messages are imperfectly sent,
and delays result that may have serious consequences.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter VI.</span></h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CODES AND CIPHERS.</div>


<p>A code is a list or collection of arbitrary words or
groups of letters to each of which some ordinary word,
proper name, phrase, or sentence is assigned for
meaning.</p>

<p>Ciphers embrace all means whereby writings may
be transcribed into occult terms. All ciphers employ
some distinct method for transcription, which method
is termed a key. In practice the key is usually
applied directly in enciphering and reversed in deciphering
messages.</p>


<h3>CODES IN USE.</h3>

<p>The codes of the Western Union and Postal Telegraph
companies are examples of well-known codes
suited to general commercial use. Besides these,
many special codes have been formulated, so as to
embody technical expressions especially adapted to
use in particular lines of industry. The War Department
Code is a military code adapted to the special
needs of the military establishment in peace and war.</p>


<h3>EMPLOYMENT OF CODES.</h3>

<p>Codes are primarily intended for economy, but they
may also be readily employed to secure secrecy. When
used solely for economy, the coded message is said to
be plain code; that is, the word or phrases of the message
are coded by direct reference to their respective
code equivalents. Thus plain code is readily translatable
to anyone in possession of a code book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
When secrecy is desired, some method of enciphering
or key is employed in such a way that only persons
in possession of it can in conjunction with the code
book decipher it. In such case the message is said
to be in cipher code.</p>


<h3>CIPHER CODE.</h3>

<p>In all codes each expression and its equivalent in
plain language is assigned a number. These numbers
usually commence at unity and increase consecutively
to any desired figure. Messages may be
enciphered by means of a key number or series of numbers.
An additive number, say 55 additive, requires
that in enciphering a message, the fifty-fifth word
numerically greater than the proper code word shall
be used; if 55 subtractive is used, the fifty-fifth word
numerically smaller than the proper code word is to
be used. By agreement a single key number can be
used alternately additive and subtractive, that is, first
additive, second subtractive, third additive, etc.</p>

<p>The key numbers are used over and over until the entire
message is enciphered. The key number can sometimes
be expressed by a single word, as, for instance,
"Grant," each letter having a value of tens in accordance
with its position in the alphabet; that is, G, the
seventh letter equals 70; R equals 180; A equals 10;
N equals 140; and T equals 200. Or by preconcerted
arrangement letters may represent units or hundreds.
Security from translation by persons not having the
key number is greater when the key numbers are used
alternately additive and subtractive. If a cipher
key word is used, it should be one of an odd number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
letters, as, for instance, "Jones," the numbers corresponding
to the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
The first number should be additive, the second subtractive,
etc. By this means the first letter of the key
word is additive the first time it is used, subtractive
the second, additive the third, and so on. In some
instances the key number, when added to or subtracted
from the code number, gives a resulting number
exceeding the highest code number or less than
unity. In cases of this kind it should be remembered
in enciphering that unity follows the highest code
number in addition, and that the highest code number
follows unity in subtraction. In deciphering a
message the process of enciphering is reversed.</p>


<h3>THE WAR DEPARTMENT CODE.</h3>

<p>As previously stated, the War Department Code
is the technical military code and contains expressions
numbered consecutively from 1 to 62,000.
All the code words are composed of 6 letters, which are
so arranged that the vowels and consonants invariably
alternate. In the formation of code words the following
13 letters only are used, viz, A, B, D, E, F, G,
I, K, M, N, S, U, and X. The body of the code book
is arranged as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Army list, containing the name of every commissioned
officer in the regular establishment.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Military organizations, giving all batteries, companies,
troops, etc.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Military posts and stations, covering Alaska, Hawaii,
Philippine Islands, Porto Rico, and the United States.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) United States naval stations and vessels.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Geographical names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Miscellaneous tables as follows:</p>

<div class='list2'>
Numerals.<br />
Arrivals and departures.<br />
Dates.<br />
Indorsements.<br />
Letter acknowledgments.<br />
Requisitions.<br />
Telegram acknowledgments.<br />
Mails, shipments, and transports.<br />
Blanks for future additions as they may be needed.<br />
Ranks and grades of officers and men in the Army.<br />
Wireless stations of the Army and Navy.<br />
</div>

<p>(<i>g</i>) Alphabetical list of code expressions arranged conveniently
for use.</p></blockquote>

<p>When it is desired to transmit some word or expression
not to be found in the code and no suitable synonym
can be discovered the word or expression should
be sent in plain language or spelled out by the equivalents
for letters and endings to be found on page 589.</p>

<p>Complete instructions for the use of the code either
as a code or cipher are contained in the introductory
pages of the book.</p>


<h3>CIPHER CODE IN FIELD WORK.</h3>

<p>The use of cipher code in enciphering field messages
will usually be practicable only between the several
headquarters and other large stations supplied with
code books. This method, too, is prohibitive for urgent
messages when the time of enciphering and deciphering
is an important factor connected with delivery.</p>


<h3>FIELD CIPHERS.</h3>

<p><i>Description and use.</i>&mdash;Field ciphers include all systems
and the apparatus connected therewith which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
are ordinarily employed in enciphering and deciphering
field messages. Field ciphers are intended for use
when code books are not available, and hence the employment
of cipher code is precluded. Some methods
of field cipher employ simple forms of apparatus, while
others require the use of no apparatus at all.</p>

<p><i>Forms of field cipher.</i>&mdash;There are two general classes
of field cipher. The first class employs the transposition
or reversal of the letters or words of a message
according to some preconcerted rule as a means of
secrecy. The route cipher hereafter described is an
example of this class. The method used in ciphers of
the second class consists in the substitution of certain
letters or symbols for each of the individual letters
composing the words of the message. Both classes of
cipher can be rendered more efficient by a judicious
use of inversions and by the concealment of terminations.</p>

<p><i>Inversions.</i>&mdash;By the inversions of the whole or certain
parts of messages, according to some preconcerted
arrangement, the complications of cipher can be greatly
increased. If a message is to be inverted, either as a
whole or by clauses, it should be inverted before the
cipher letters are written over it. Messages may be
further complicated by sending the letters of each
word backward in various other prearranged combinations.</p>

<p><i>Concealment of terminations.</i>&mdash;To evade the discovery
of the key or keys employed, it is most important
that the termination of the words of a message should
be concealed. The best method to conceal the beginning,
and at the same time the termination of words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
is to divide them into arbitrary groups of four or five
letters each. This procedure will add immeasurably
to the strength of the cipher and should in no way
confuse one in possession of the key. For instance,
the words "sufficient time" would be divided "suff"
"icie" "ntti" "me," and such blind letters as may be
agreed upon to fill the last two spaces of the last group.
All such artifices as this will surely delay a translator
not in possession of the key.</p>


<h3>CIPHER APPARATUS.</h3>

<p><i>The cipher disk.</i>&mdash;The cipher disk is composed of
two disks of cardboard, leather, or other material
joined concentrically, the upper disk revolving upon
the lower. The alphabet, reading from left to right,
and such other signals, numerals, or combinations of
letters, as may be desired, are printed around the
circumference of the lower disk. On the upper disk
are printed the alphabet and such other signals, numerals,
or combinations of letters as are printed on
the lower disk. On the lower disk they are printed
from left to right, while on the upper disk they are
printed from right to left. If it is desired to encipher
a message, the key letter or the first letter of the key
word or words is set opposite "A." Let us assume
it to be "J." The cipher letters to be written are
those opposite the text letter when the letter "a" on
the upper disk is set opposite "J" on the lower disk.
For example, "Send powder" would be written "rfwg
uvngfs."</p>

<p>Having a cipher disk as above described, this mere
transposition of letters would delay but a short time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the deciphering of a message by one not knowing the
key letter, as it would be necessary only to place, in
turn, opposite "a" each of the letters of the alphabet
beginning with "b" and noting the letters opposite
the enciphered letters. But this simple disk can be
used with a cipher word, or preferably, cipher words
known only to the correspondents, and it is entirely
improbable that a message so enciphered could be
deciphered in time to be of any value to the enemy.
Using the key words "permanent body" to encipher
the message "Reenforcements will reach you at daylight,"
we would proceed as follows: Write out the
message to be enciphered and above it write the key
word or key words, letter over letter, thus:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="code and message">
<tr><td align="center">P</td><td align="center">E</td><td align="center">R</td><td align="center">M</td><td align="center">A</td><td align="center">N</td><td align="center">E</td><td align="center">N</td><td align="center">T</td><td align="center">B</td><td align="center">O</td><td align="center">D</td><td align="center">Y</td><td align="center">P</td><td align="center">E</td><td align="center">R</td><td align="center">M</td><td align="center">A</td><td align="center">N</td><td align="center">E</td><td align="center">N</td><td align="center">T</td><td align="center">B</td><td align="center">O</td><td align="center">D</td><td align="center">Y</td><td align="center">P</td><td align="center">E</td><td align="center">R</td><td align="center">M</td><td align="center">A</td><td align="center">N</td><td align="center">E</td><td align="center">N</td><td align="center">T</td><td align="center">B</td></tr>

<tr><td align="center">y</td><td align="center">a</td><td align="center">n</td><td align="center">z</td><td align="center">v</td><td align="center">z</td><td align="center">n</td><td align="center">l</td><td align="center">p</td><td align="center">p</td><td align="center">k</td><td align="center">q</td><td align="center">f</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">i</td><td align="center">j</td><td align="center">b</td><td align="center"><span class="small">B</span></td><td align="center">p</td><td align="center">w</td><td align="center">a</td><td align="center">n</td><td align="center">r</td><td align="center">u</td><td align="center">q</td><td align="center">p</td><td align="center">e</td><td align="center">p</td><td align="center">l</td><td align="center">o</td><td align="center">m</td><td align="center">c</td><td align="center">c</td><td align="center">w</td><td align="center">h</td><td align="center">m</td><td align="center">i</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Now bring the "a" of the upper disk under the first
letter of the key word on the lower disk, in this case
"P." The first letter of the message to be enciphered
is "R." "Y" is found to be the letter connected with
"R" and it is put down as the first cipher letter. The
letter "a" is then brought under "E," which is the
second letter of the key word. "E" is to be enciphered
and "a" is found to be the second cipher letter.
Then bring "a" to "R" and the cipher letter will represent
"e," the third text letter of the message. Proceed
in this manner until the last letter of the cipher
words is used, and, beginning again with the letter
"P," so continue until all letters of the message have
been enciphered. Divided into groups of four letters,
it will be as follows: "yanz vznl ppkq fxij bpwa
nruq pepl omcc whmi."</p>

<p>To decipher the message, reverse the proceedings
above described; thus the letter "a" on the upper
disk is brought under the first letter of the key word
"P." Following these instructions, we find the first
cipher letter of the message; "a" is then brought to
the next letter of the key word. In this case "E" is,
of course, the next letter of the text. "R" is the
next letter in the key and "a" is brought over it.
The cipher letter "n" gives us the next text letter,
which is "e," and so on until the completion of the
message. If the letters of the key word or phrase are
exhausted, begin again with the first letter and so
continue until the entire message is deciphered.</p>

<p>With a key word, or, preferably, a key phrase of
three or four words, the deciphering of a message is
extremely difficult.</p>

<p>In a military cipher message, it may be desired to
transmit numerals, the spelling out of which would
require considerable time. This can be done by an
arrangement of the cipher disk so that the numerals
of which will appear in the same order as and follow
the letters of the alphabet. Thus on the lower disk 1
is placed opposite A; 2 opposite B; 3 opposite C; 4
opposite D; 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0 opposite E, F, G, H,
I, and J, respectively.</p>

<p>On the upper disk the above numerals also appear,
beginning numeral 1 opposite A; 2 opposite B, etc.,
0 being opposite J.</p>

<p>The arbitrary sign XX will be used to indicate
"numerals follow" and "numerals end." Supposing
then we wish to send the following message: "Send
6,000 cavalry at once," and that the key word was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
"Washington." Following the instructions heretofore
given for enciphering, we would place the words
as follows:</p>

<p>In place of a disk means may be extemporized by
taking two strips of paper, on one of which the alphabet,

On the other, with equal spacing, the alphabet, etc.,

<h3>THE MATHEMATICAL CIPHER.</h3>

<p>This cipher is a highly efficient one for the purpose
of secrecy and at the same time requires no apparatus
whatever attendant upon its use. The cipher is constructed
as follows: Commit to memory the alphabet
by numbers, viz, A, 1; B, 2; etc. Take any key word,
phrase, or sentence desired; for example, "A discovery."
Suppose the message to be enciphered is
"Send me powder tonight." The enciphering of the
message using the key given above will be as follows:</p>

<p>To encipher, first write out the key, letter by letter,
placing the message letter by letter beneath it. Then
reduce the letters of the key and the message to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
numeral alphabetical equivalents. Add the individual
columns and subtract unity from each. From any
result thus found, which exceeds the number of letters
in the alphabet, the number 26 must be subtracted.
The final totals reduced to letters by numerical alphabetical
equivalents will then give the cipher.</p>

<h3>THE ROUTE CIPHER.</h3>

<p>This is a cipher in which the words or a message
are retained unchanged, but are so disarranged by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
preconcerted rules that the sense becomes unintelligible.
The message as received seems to be a number
of disconnected words and without meaning, but by
arrangement in proper order in accordance with certain
rules can be easily read. Messages enciphered
in this manner may be translated by persons not in
possession of the key, and therefore the information
contained therein should only be of such a character
as to be of little value to the enemy unless acted upon
immediately. The usual method employed in arranging
a message for this cipher is to write the words in
vertical columns. The number of words in each
column should always equal the number of columns,
being made so, if necessary, by the addition of sufficient
"blind" words. A preconcerted route is agreed upon,
as up to the first column, down the third, up the
second, etc. The message is then transmitted without
reference to the columns, but is deciphered at the
receiving station by column arrangement and perusal
along the original route.</p>

<p>For example, to encipher the message "Move daylight.
Enemy approaching from north. Prisoners
say strength one hundred thousand. Meet him as
planned," arrange as follows:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="route cipher example">
<tr><td align="left">Move</td><td align="left">strength</td><td align="left">planned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left">say</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">daylight</td><td align="left">one</td><td align="left">as</td><td align="left">prisoners</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">enemy</td><td align="left">hundred</td><td align="left">him</td><td align="left">north</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">approaching&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left">thousand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left">meet</td><td align="left">from</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Here the route is down the first column, up the
fourth, down the second, and up the third.</p>

<h3>CIPHER DETECTION.</h3>

<p><i>General instructions.</i>&mdash;In deciphering a message in
which the same cipher letter or symbol is uniformly
used to represent the same text letter, the following
data will be of assistance.</p>

<p>The proportion of occurrence of letters of the alphabet
in English words is as follows: For every 2 of the
letter Q there are 4 of the letter X, 8 of K, 16 of B,
13 of C, 80 of I, N, O, and S; 85 of A, 90 of T, and
120 of letter E.</p>

<p>The compounds most frequently met with are NG
EE LL MM TT DD and NN.</p>

<p>The order of frequency in which the letters of the
alphabet occur as initial letters in words is as follows:</p>

<div class='center'>
S, C, P, A, D, I, F, B, L, T.<br />
</div>


<h3><i>Employment of Cipher Disk.</i></h3>

<p>If messages are enciphered by a mere transposition
of the letters of the alphabet, the cipher disk can be
used to quickly decipher the message, as the following
example will show: Assuming that F is used to
represent A, G to represent B, H to represent C,
I to represent D, J to represent E, etc., in regular
sequence, and that the message to be enciphered is:
"We are short of rifle ammunition; send 30,000
rounds at once."</p>

<p>This would be enciphered if divided into groups of
four letters as follows:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="code">
<tr><td align="left">jbfo</td><td align="left">bnyr</td><td align="left">omra</td><td align="left">oxub</td><td align="left">fuls</td><td align="left">xmxr</td><td align="left">snbs</td><td align="left">cmjb</td><td align="left">smhm</td><td align="left">yrln</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">fsco</td><td align="left">rlsc</td><td align="left">nfmr</td><td align="left">sdb.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Place "a" of the upper cipher disk under B of the
lower disk and notice whether the cipher letters
jbfo&mdash;the first group&mdash;are intelligible. They give
"sawn," continue this for "saw," the first three letters,
may be the text word. Now the next group is
B N Y R and these give A O D K. We know that A
does not represent B because the first 8 cipher letters
give the meaningless letters "sawnaodk." Turn "a"
to C and we have for the first group T B X O, which
is without meaning. Turning "a" to D we get
U C Y P, a meaningless jumble. Turn "a" to E and
we get V D Z Q, which is meaningless. Now turn
"a" under F and we find that JBFO mean "Wear,"
which, so far at least, gives us a part of a word, or the
word "We" and part of another word. We continue
to the next group B N Y R, which gives us
"esho." We now have these letters "Wearesho,"
which at a glance we read "We are sho;" continuing
to the next group O M R A the cipher disk gives us
"rtof," and we read "We are short of" and know we
have found the key letter, and the information hidden
in the cipher is ours. Continue deciphering with "a"
under F until the end of the message. Sometimes
the key letter is changed after two, three, or four
letters.</p>

<p>It is a matter of minutes only to run through the
alphabet and learn the meaning of a message so
enciphered.</p>

<h3>Reflection&mdash;refraction&mdash;lenses.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 264px;"><a id="Figure_20"></a>
<img src="images/i_103.png" width="264" height="85" alt="drawing side view of curved lenses" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span></div>
</div>

<p>When light falls on a transparent body, part is
reflected and part is refracted. The angle which the
ray makes with the normal, or perpendicular, to the
surface at the point of contact is known as the angle
of incidence, and the angles which the reflected and
refracted rays make with the same normal are known
respectively as the angle of reflection and refraction.
The reflected ray makes the same angle with the normal
as the incident ray, while the refracted ray, when
passing from a rarer to a
denser medium, is bent
toward the normal, and
vice versa; the denser the
medium into which the
ray passes the greater is
the deviation. This law allows us at once to understand
the action of a lens, which may be defined as a transparent
medium that from the curvature of its surface
causes the rays of light traversing it to either converge
or diverge. The ordinary lenses have either
spherical surfaces or a combination of spherical and
plane surfaces. This combination will give rise to six
classes (<a href="#Figure_20">fig. 20</a>): (<i>a</i>) Double convex; (<i>b</i>) plano convex;
(<i>c</i>) double concave; (<i>d</i>) plano concave; (<i>e</i>) converging,
and (<i>f</i>) diverging meniscus. Those lenses
which are thicker at the center than at the edges are
converging or concentrating lenses, and those which
are thicker at the edges than the center are diverging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>


<h3>FOCUS&mdash;OPTICAL CENTER.</h3>

<p>The focus of a lens is the point where the refracted
rays or their prolongation meet; if the rays themselves
intersect after refraction the focus is real, and if their
prolongations meet the focus is virtual. The line
passing through the centers of curvature of the two
surfaces of a lens is called the principal axis and contains
a point known as the optical center, which has the
property by virtue of which, if a ray passes through
it, the ray will not be deviated. The optical center
can always be found by drawing two radii parallel to
each other, one from each center of the curvature of
the surface until the radii intersect their respective
surfaces, then draw a line joining these two points.
The intersection of this last line with the principal
axis will give the optical center.</p>


<h3>IMAGE&mdash;CONJUGATE FOCI.</h3>

<p>Let AB be the section of a double convex lens and
C and D (<a href="#Figure_21">fig. 21</a>) be the centers of curvature of the
two surfaces. Draw the lines CD&prime; and DE from C and
D parallel to each other, then join D&prime; and E by a
straight line. The point O will be the optical center
of the lens. Let us take a point R, on the principal
axis as a source of light; the ray RD passes through
the optical center and is not deviated. The ray RK
on striking will be refracted in the direction KG
toward the perpendicular to the surface KD in accordance
with the law of refraction, as glass is denser than
air. On emerging at G it is refracted away from the
perpendicular to the surface CG, since it passes from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
denser to a rarer medium, and will intersect the ray
RD at the point R&prime;. In a like way the ray RK&prime; will
be found to intersect the ray RD at the same point,
R&prime;, which is the focus for all rays coming from R. The
point R&prime; is said to be the image of the object R, and
when the two points are considered together they are
called conjugate foci. If the incident beam is composed
of parallel homogeneous light, the rays will all
be brought to a focus at a point on the principal axis,
called the principal focus of the lens, and the distance
of this point from the optical center is the principal
focal length, which is always a fixed quantity for any
given lens.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;"><a id="Figure_21"></a>
<img src="images/i_105.png" width="395" height="148" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span></div>
</div>


<h3>LAW OF FOCI.</h3>

<p>There is a fixed relation between the principal focal
length of a double convex lens and the position of the
image of the object which may be expressed as follows:
<small><sup>1</sup>/<sub><i>i</i></sub></small> = <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub><i>f</i></sub></small> - <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub><i>o</i></sub></small>, in which <i>i</i> and <i>o</i> are the distances of
the image and object, respectively, from the optical
center and <i>f</i> the focal length, from which we see that for
all positions of the object from an infinite distance
away from the lens to double the principal focal distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the image will be on the other side, between a distance
equal to the principal focal length and double this
length. These are the limits of the image and object in
the ordinary cases. If we place this expression in the
following form: <i>i</i> = <sup><i>of</i></sup>/<sub>(<i>o</i> - <i>f</i>)</sub>, and suppose the object to
remain the same distance from various lenses, it will
be seen that the image will be closer to the lens which
has the shorter focal length. The principal focal distance,
or, briefly, the focal length of the lens, depends
on the curvature of the surfaces, and the greater the
curvature the shorter the focal length.</p>


<h3>FORMATION OF IMAGE.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 426px;"><a id="Figure_22"></a>
<img src="images/i_106.png" width="426" height="175" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Let us now see how an image is formed by a convex
lens, and suppose that CD is the section of a double
convex lens (<a href="#Figure_22">fig. 22</a>), O the optical center, and AB an
object at a greater distance from the optical center
than double the focal length. Rays will pass out in
all directions from the object and some will fall on the
lens. A ray from A will pass through the optical center
and will not be deviated; others will be incident
at various points, for example, E and G, and if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
apply the law of refraction we will find that AE and
AG will intersect each other and AO at the point A&prime;,
provided we do not consider the figure of the lens,
forming one point of the image A&prime; B&prime;; similarly for
rays from other points of the object, as, for example, B,
we can construct the focus B&prime;, and thus obtain the
image A&prime; B&prime;, which is inverted and smaller than the
object AB. The relative size of the image and object
will be directly as the conjugate foci, and these can be
found at once from the equation of the lens.</p>


<h3>SPHERICAL ABERRATION.</h3>

<p>If, however, we consider the form of the lens, we
will find that all the rays emerging from one point on
the object are not brought to the same focus, because
the rays incident on the edges of the lens are refracted
to a greater extent than those falling on the center,
and will be brought to a focus at a shorter distance from
the lens than those passing through the central part.
This confusion or wandering of the foci from one point
is called spherical aberration, or aberration of form, and
is due solely to the geometrical form of the lens.</p>

<h3>CHROMATIC ABERRATION.</h3>

<p>In what has been said about the visual image we
have supposed that the light was monochromatic, or
homogeneous. Let us see what will happen if the
light is polychromatic, say, for example, sunlight, and
let a beam of sunlight be intercepted on a screen after
passing through a double convex lens. It will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
observed, as in <a href="#Figure_23">figure 23</a>, that the violet rays are
brought to a focus nearest the lens, and the red farthest
away, and circles of light will be seen on the screen;
this wandering of the colored rays from a common
focus is called chromatic aberration and depends on
the dispersive properties of the material of which the
lens is made. Here is a defect that can not be corrected
by a stop, but as the refractive
and dispersive properties of a substance
do not vary together, it is possible to
combine two substances, one with high
refractive and low dispersive properties
and the other with the reverse properties.
If proper curves are given to them
they will correct each other, thereby
producing coincidence of the visible and
chromatic foci. Such a combination
gives an achromatic lens, which is usually
composed of a double convex of
crown glass cemented to a diverging meniscus of flint
glass, as shown in section in <a href="#Figure_24">figure 24</a>. This combination
is not absolutely achromatic, but sufficiently
so for all general purposes.</p>

<h3>TELESCOPES.</h3>

<p>The telescope is an optical instrument based on an
object glass or reflector to form a real image of a real
and distant object, and of an ocular to magnify and
view the image. Telescopes are classified as refracting
or reflecting according as the object glass is a lens or a
reflector. The object glass must be essentially convex
if the telescope is a refractor, and if a reflector,
the object mirror must be concave; the ocular may be
either concave or convex.</p>

<p>There are four types of refractive telescopes used for
military purposes, viz:</p>

<ol>
<li>The astronomical.<br /></li>
<li>The terrestrial.<br /></li>
<li>The galilean.<br /></li>
<li>The prismatic.<br /></li>
</ol>

<p><a href="#Figure_26">Figure 26</a> is a section of an astronomical telescope.
The object glass (<i>D</i>) is a combination consisting of a
double convex and a double concave lens cemented
together with Canada balsam. The double concave
lens is added to correct for chromatic aberration. The
ocular (<i>E</i>) is a convex-concave lens.</p>

<p>Rays of light from some distant object are converged
by the objective (<i>D</i>) and form an inverted image (<i>ab</i>)
at the <i>focal</i> plane (<i>F</i>). The eye lens (<i>E</i>) receives the
divergent pencils from <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> and bend them so that
they enter the eye as if coming apparently from the
direction of <i>a&prime; b&prime;</i> where the apparent image is seen.
From the eyepiece (<i>E</i>) the rays emerge in a cone of
pencils of light smaller than the pupil of the eye, which
enables a telescope of this type to have a large field of
view. The image, however, is inverted and the astronomical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
telescope in its original form is therefore not
suitable for military purposes. In a modified form
it is much used, as will be shown in a later paragraph.</p>

<p><a href="#Figure_27">Figure 27</a> is a section of a terrestrial telescope much
used for military purposes. Glasses of this type are
quite generally known as "spyglasses."</p>

<p>As in the case of the astronomical telescope, the
first inverted image <i>ba</i> is formed at the focal plane (<i>F</i>),
and the first eyeglass converges these pencils to <i>L</i>.
Instead of placing the eye at <i>L</i>, as in the astronomical
telescope, the pencils are allowed to cross and fall on
a second eyeglass, by which the rays of each pencil are
converged to a point in the second erect image <i>a&prime; b&prime;</i>,
which image is viewed by means of the third and last
eyeglass.</p>

<p>Terrestrial telescopes have a comparatively small
field of view. The barrels of this telescope are necessarily
long on account of the additional lenses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>


<h3>GALILEAN FIELD GLASSES AND TELESCOPES.</h3>

<p><a href="#Figure_28">Figure 28</a> is a section of a Galilean telescope which
differs from the astronomical telescope in having a
double concave instead of a double convex, eyepiece
or ocular.</p>

<p>In this telescope the rays from an object are converged
by the object glass (<i>O</i>) and would normally
focus at the focal plane (<i>C</i>) and there form the inverted
image <i>ba</i> were it not that the double concave eyeglass
or ocular (<i>D</i>) is so located in the barrel of the telescope
as to intercept the pencils before they are
focused. This double concave eyeglass diverges these
pencils and forms a magnified erect image <i>a&prime; b&prime;</i>
apparently at <i>E</i>. Due to the diverging action of this
concave eye lens, the cone of pencils entering the eye
is larger than the pupil of the eye, and therefore but a
small part of the field gathered by the object glass is
utilized by the eye, which causes telescopes of this
type to have a comparatively small field of view.</p>

<h3>PORRO PRISM FIELD GLASSES AND TELESCOPES.</h3>

<p>In 1850 a French engineer, Porro, discovered a
combination of prisms which, when inserted between
the objective and the eyepiece of an astronomical telescope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
showed the image erect or in its natural position,
while the same telescope without the prisms
showed the image inverted. Practical use of this discovery
was not made for many years after. These
prisms served a twofold purpose, viz, showing the
image of the object looked at in its natural position
instead of reversed, and second, the shortening of the
telescope by twice turning the ray of light upon itself.
Each tube of the prism field glass contains two of these
double-reflecting prisms. The ray of light passing
through the object glass enters the first prism in such
a manner as to be twice totally reflected, each time at
an angle of 90&deg;, thus emerging parallel to the entering
ray, but in the opposite direction. It is thus caught
by the second prism and is similarly reflected and sent
on its original direction without change except in one
very important point, viz, the image of the object
observed, which, without the intervention of the
prism, would be upside down, is now erect, and will be
magnified by the simple astronomical eyepiece just as
the stars and planets are magnified in large telescopes.</p>

<p>The field of view of the Porro prism glass is considerably
larger than that of the ordinary field glass. It
decreases about 12&frac12; per cent with each magnifying
power, a number 6-power glass giving a linear view of
118 feet in a thousand, while in a number 10 glass the
field is but 70 linear feet. This is explained as follows:</p>

<p>The rays of light emerging from the ocular of the
Galilean telescope are divergent and cover an area
much greater than the size of the pupil of the eye. As
all rays falling outside the pupil of the eye are lost, but
a small field of view can be seen, as in looking through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
an ordinary cone from the larger end. The prism
glasses are constructed on the opposite principle.
The rays of light gathered by the objective emerge
from the eyepiece in a converging pencil of light small
enough to enter the pupil of the eye, thus giving a
larger field of view; theoretically, nine times the area
given by the old-style instrument of the same power.
With these advantages, however, the Porro prism
glass has not been found in all respects satisfactory
for field service. With a clear atmosphere and the
object which is being
viewed well
illuminated, it is
distinctly superior
to the Galilean
field-type glass in
respect to light,
power, and definition.
The prisms
having once been deranged, however slightly, satisfactory
use of the glass can not be had until the prisms
have been readjusted, and until very recently it was
impracticable to have this done elsewhere than at the
place of manufacture of the glass.</p>

<h3>FIELD GLASSES.</h3>

<p>The field glass or binocular is a combination of two
similar telescopes and possesses mechanical adjustments
capable of focusing the two telescopes simultaneously
or separately, depending upon the type
considered.</p>

<p>Field glasses are divided into two general classes,
viz, the Galilean glasses and the Porro prism glasses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>


<h3>PROPERTIES OF TELESCOPES AND FIELD GLASSES.</h3>

<p>Telescopes and field glasses have four properties,
viz, power, light, field, and definition. These properties
are expressed in terms of the corresponding
qualities of the unaided eye.</p>

<p>Eyes are of very different capabilities. Some
people have "short" sight while others have "far"
sight. There are normal, excellent, and weak eyes.
In the following discussion the capabilities of the
normal eye are assumed.</p>

<p>For each individual there is a certain distance at
which objects may be most distinctly seen. This
is called the "visual distance." With shortsighted
eyes this distance is from 3 to 6 inches; with normal
eyes, from 8 to 14 inches, and with farsighted eyes,
from 16 to 28 inches.</p>

<p>The capabilities of the normal unassisted eye may
therefore be expressed as follows: Power, 1; light, 1;
field, 45&deg;; definition, 40&prime;&prime; to 3&prime;.</p>

<p><i>Power.</i>&mdash;At the "visual distance," all objects seen
by the unaided normal eye appear in their natural
size. At less than the "visual distance" they appear
indistinct, blurred, and imperfectly defined; at greater
than the "visual distance" objects are clear and well
defined, but diminish in size, the more so as they are
farther removed.</p>

<p>The ability of a lens to magnify the apparent
diameter of an object is termed its power.</p>

<p>The power of a lens is defined as the ratio of the
diameter of the object as seen through the lens to
the diameter as viewed by the unaided eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The power is also defined as the ratio of the focal
distance of the object glass to that of the eyepiece.</p>

<p>The power of a field glass can be roughly determined
by focusing the instrument on a wall or a range rod,
by looking at the object through the instrument with
one eye and at the same object directly with the
unaided eye. A comparison of the diameter of the
two images gives the ratio.</p>

<p>The power of a telescope or a field glass can more
accurately be measured by means of a dynameter,
which is a microscope which can be fitted over the
eyepiece end of the instrument, and which magnifies
the image. The end of the dynameter next to the
eyepiece of the instrument is ruled with a series of lines
one-hundredth of an inch apart. On focusing the
dynameter, the image of the emerging pencil appears
as a sharply defined ring of light with the magnified
scale of the dynameter across it.</p>

<p>The number of subdivisions covered by the diameter
of the ring of light is noted. The diameter of the
object glass is similarly measured by means of a pair
of dividers and read to the hundredth part of an inch.</p>

<p>The ratio of the diameter of the object glass to that
of the image as seen in the dynameter gives the power
of the instrument. This method is not applicable in
the case of the Galilean telescope or the field glass
consisting of two Galilean telescopes, due to the fact
that the rays from the eyepiece of the Galilean telescope
are divergent.</p>

<p>Field glasses in which the image appears magnified
from one to six diameters are known as "low-power"
glasses. Field glasses which produce an image
magnified over six diameters are termed "high power."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>For the mounted man a glass of but 4, or at most 6,
powers, can be used with advantage; on foot, with free
hand, instruments of not to exceed 10 powers can be
used. If more than 10 powers are desired, a holder
becomes necessary, and if the holder is intended to be
portable a greater power than 50 is not practicable,
as the movement of the air or the slightest touch of
the hand sets up vibrations that render clear vision
impossible.</p>

<p>Field glasses with low magnifying power, which are
usually preferred by ordinary observers, have their
chief value in the comparatively extensive field of view;
they should be used to observe extensive movements,
where large tracts of country must be taken in one
field of view or in sweeping the landscape to find the
tents of the enemy, their wagons, etc., or other objects,
to be afterwards more closely examined with the telescope.</p>

<p>They may be used on shipboard or in boats, where
the rolling motion interferes with the use of the telescope;
also on horseback or in hasty examination
made on foot or in trees, and generally for all observations
not critical or those to be made under circumstances
where the telescope can not be conveniently
handled. The field glass ought to be held by both
hands when in use, and to steady it the arms should be
kept close to the body.</p>

<p>For reading signals at short ranges, say, up to 5
miles, these glasses are better than the telescope.
Flag signals have frequently been read with glasses of
this description at a distance of 10 miles.</p>

<p><i>Light.</i>&mdash;The illumination of an object when observed
with the unaided eye is impressed upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
retina with a brightness in strict proportion to that
of the object itself. If an object be viewed under
equal illuminating conditions alternately with the
naked eye and with a glass, the brightness of the
image seen with the naked eye may be represented
by 1, while that of the image in the glass will generally
differ, being greater or less.</p>

<p>The light of the telescope or field glass is expressed
by the number which shows how many times brighter
the object appears through the instrument than to the
naked eye. Light is a function of the dimensions
of the object glass and of the power of the instrument,
and is sometimes determined by dividing the square
of the objective aperture (expressed in millimeters)
by the square of the power.</p>

<p>The light of a telescope or field glass can also be
determined by means of the absorption apparatus
shown in <a href="#Figure_30">figure 30</a> (<i>a</i>) (<i>b</i>) (<i>c</i>).</p>

<p>This absorption apparatus operates on the principle
of viewing an object through a perfectly black liquid,
which absorbs all colors equally, and of increasing the
thickness of the liquid layer until the object becomes
invisible. The thickness of the layer of liquid will
then be a measure of the relative brightness or intensity
of the illumination.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a id="Figure_30"></a><a id="Figure_30a"></a><a id="Figure_30b"></a><a id="Figure_30c"></a>
<img src="images/i_118.png" width="500" height="652" alt="Figures 30a, 30b and 30c" />
</div>

<p>The apparatus consists of two wedge-shaped vessels,
made of brass, with glass windows in the sides. One
of these vessels is shown in perspective in <a href="#Figure_30">figure 30</a><i>a</i>.
The sides <i>A</i> and the one opposite are of glass. <i>B</i> is
tubulure for filling the apparatus, and is stopped with
a cap. The operation of the apparatus is shown diagrammatically
in <a href="#Figure_30b">figures 30<i>b</i></a> and <a href="#Figure_30c">30<i>c</i></a>. The edges of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the two wedges which come together are divided into
scales of equal parts of convenient magnitude. Each
scale begins with zero; not at the extreme point of the
wedge outside, but at a point, which, allowing for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
thickness of the glass sides, is opposite the point of the
wedge of liquid inside. It will be observed in figures
30<i>b</i> and 30<i>c</i> that the sum of any two adjacent numbers,
on the respective scales, over the whole overlapping
portion of the wedges, is the same. Thus in
<a href="#Figure_30">figure 30</a><i>b</i> it is 11, and in <a href="#Figure_30">figure 30</a><i>c</i> it is 7. These
figures measure the relative thickness of the liquid
layers in the two respective settings of the apparatus.
Suppose the image is just obliterated, when looking
with the unaided eye, at the setting shown in figure
30<i>b</i>, and when using the glass at the setting shown
in <a href="#Figure_30">figure 30</a><i>c</i>. This would mean that the illuminating
power of the glass is seven-elevenths. In using the
apparatus, a focusing cloth, used by all photographers,
is useful in excluding stray light.</p>

<p><i>Field.</i>&mdash;Maintaining the head and eyes as motionless
as possible, the field of vision of the unaided eye
or the range within which objects can be perceived
by the unaided eye varies according to direction.</p>

<p>De Schweinitz gives the following limits: Outward,
90&deg;; outward and upward, 70&deg;; upward, 50&deg;; upward
and inward, 55&deg;; inward, 60&deg;; inward and downward,
55&deg;; downward, 72&deg;; downward and outward, 85&deg;.</p>

<p>It may be safely said that the field or "visual angle"
of the unaided eye for <i>distinct</i> vision is at least 45&deg; in
all directions.</p>

<p>The "visual angle" or "field" of a field glass is
always smaller, no field glass having yet been designed
which could equal the field of the unaided eye.</p>

<p>The field of a telescope or field glass can best be
determined by the use of a transit or other instrument
used in measuring horizontal angles. The glass
is placed upon the telescope of the transit in such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
way that the axes of collimation of the transit and
the telescope or field glass are parallel. The extreme
limits of the field of view are marked and the horizontal
angle between the markers noted on the limb of
the transit.</p>

<p><i>Definition.</i>&mdash;One of the chief qualities of the eye is
its power of defining outlines and details distinctly.
Relative characteristics in this respect may be determined
in various ways. Thus the distance at which
printed matter can be read, or the details of a distant
object distinguished, will give a fair measure of the
defining power of the eye; but a better method is to
express the definition of sight by angular measurement&mdash;that
is, by the determination of the smallest
visual angle giving clear results. Experience teaches
that this angle of the normal eye (with good light and
favorable color conditions) is about 40&prime;&prime;, and it is
therefore possible to determine the smallest object
which can just be seen, well defined, at an arbitrary distance.
For instance, at a distance of 15 feet an object
can be seen which is one-twentieth of an inch high or
broad; at 30 feet distance, consequently, the object
must be twice the size (one-tenth of an inch) to be
seen, and so on relatively, within limits, as distance increases.
But as the distance becomes greater sharpness
of vision is impaired materially by the interposing
atmosphere, while it is also affected by color contrasts
and conditions of illumination. It therefore follows
that at considerable distances objects which subtend a
visual angle of 40&prime;&prime; are no longer clearly defined but
become so only as the angle approaches 60&prime;&prime;, 120&prime;&prime;,
180&prime;&prime;, or more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The most important and essential quality of a telescope
or field glass is definition, i. e., the sharpness,
clearness, and the purity of the images seen through
it. To obtain good definition it is necessary that
spherical and chromatic aberration be overcome, that
the polish of the lenses be as perfect as possible, that
the cement possess no inequalities, and that the lenses
be well focused, that there be no dampness in the interior
of the tubes, and, generally, that the instrument
be without optical defect.</p>

<p>Faults in this direction are discovered at once by
examination of definition, whereas in determining the
other constants they are less noticeable. In comparing
the definition of any two instruments it is ordinarily
necessary only to scan distant objects and observe to
what extent details may be distinguished.</p>

<p>The following test may also be used: Focus on
printed matter at a distance just beyond that at which
perfect clearness is given and gradually approach until
the letters are distinctly defined. The instrument
with which the print can be read at the greatest distance
has the best definition.</p>

<p>To express definition as an absolute measure, use
instead of printed matter, a white sheet of paper upon
which a series of heavy lines are drawn at intervals
equivalent to their thickness. Focus upon this and
gradually approach from a point where the impression
of a uniform gray field ceases and the black lines and
white intervals begin to appear distinct and defined.</p>

<p>Let the distance thus found be 20 yards and the
thickness of the lines and intervals between them one-tenth
inch. The circumference of a circle with a radius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of 20 yards or 7,200 tenths inches is 14,400 by
3.1416 or 45,240 tenth inches; but a circumference
equals 360&deg; or (360 by 60 by 60) 1,296,000&prime;&prime;.</p>

<p>If, therefore, 45,240 tenths inches correspond to
1,296,000&prime;&prime;, then 1 tenth inch equals 1,296,000 divided
by 45,240, or 28.6&prime;&prime;. The definition is therefore 28.6&prime;&prime;,
or practically half a minute.</p>

<p>The capabilities of glasses, including telescopes, in
a general way, lie between the following limits:</p>

<p>(1) Power between 2 and 1,000.</p>

<p>(2) Light may be 0.01 to 200 times that of the
unaided eye.</p>

<p>(3) Field measures in most favorable case, 10&deg;; in
the most unfavorable, .01&deg;.</p>

<p>(4) Definition varies between 40&prime;&prime; and 0.1&prime;&prime;.</p>

<p>Thus, as a maximum, an object may be seen by
means of a telescope, magnified 1,000 times, 200
times brighter and 400 times sharper than with the
naked eye.</p>

<p>If these advantages could be fully utilized for military
purposes the use of glasses would be extraordinary,
a power of 1,000 practically effecting the same
purpose as the approach of the observed object to
one-thousandth of the distance. A hostile command
10 miles distant could be seen theoretically as well as
if they were only 53 feet away, and the slightest
movement of each single man would become visible.
Of course no such wonderful effect is physically practicable,
and the limiting conditions increase greatly in
proportion as either one or the other of the qualities,
power, field, etc., is especially sought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>While astronomers require only that the telescope
be made as capable and perfect as possible in an optical
point of view, making all other conditions subordinate
to this one, the military, to whom the glass is simply
an accessory, make other conditions of the first importance.
The glass must have suitable form, small volume,
little weight, and that it may be used without
support, mounted or dismounted, and the image must
appear as looked at by the naked eye&mdash;that is, not
inverted.</p>

<p>The capability of the instrument, however, is thereby
much limited; great powers give plain images only
with relatively long tubes; glasses must be held the
steadier the more they magnify; and with increasing
power all vibrations become more troublesome and
render minute observations very difficult or impossible.
The additional lenses in terrestrial telescopes somewhat
decrease power and affect also light and definition.
It is clear therefore that expectations of achieving
great power should not be entertained, the function
of field glasses being to bring out and define objects
which to the naked eye appear indistinct and doubtful.</p>

<p>The distinctness with which anything can be seen
through the telescope depends, primarily, upon the
number of straight lines of light which are collected
by it from every point of the object.</p>

<p>Telescopes, the object glasses being equal in size,
diminish light as a general rule in proportion as their
magnifying power is great. The most powerful
glasses are therefore to be used for minute observations
on the clearest days or when there is a strong
light upon the observed object. When the light is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
fading or there is a little light upon the observed
object the clearer view will be had with glasses of
large field and low magnifying power.</p>


<h3>FIELD GLASSES AND TELESCOPES ISSUED BY THE SIGNAL
CORPS.</h3>

<p>The Signal Corps issues four standard field glasses,
viz, Type A, Type B, Type C, Type D.</p>

<p>Field glasses issued by the Signal Corps are not supplied
for the personal use of an officer and will not be
used in lieu of the officer's personal field glass prescribed
by paragraph 97, General Orders, 169, War
Department, 1907 (Par. 1, G. O. 16, War Dept., 1910).</p>

<p>Under paragraph 1582, Army Regulations, as
amended by paragraph I, General Orders, No. 207,
War Department, October 16, 1909, the Signal Corps
will sell field glasses to officers of the army for their
personal use.</p>

<p>Application for the purchase of field glasses should
be addressed to the Chief Signal Officer of the Army,
Washington, D. C., inclosing post-office money order
or check on the Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer of
the United States for the amount, payable to the Disbursing
Officer, Signal Corps, and Signal Corps Form
No. 240 accomplished in duplicate.</p>

<p>The Government does not pay transportation
charges for the shipment of articles sold to officers.
Field glasses are sent from the Signal Corps General
Supply Depot, Fort Wood, New York Harbor, by
express, charges collect, unless purchase request is
accompanied by funds so that field glasses may be
sent by registered mail. Forwarding by registered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
mail is somewhat cheaper than by express, and the
amount of postage required is 40 cents for Type D
glass, 46 cents for Types A and B, and 74 cents for
Type C. Express charges depend upon the distance
from New York.</p>

<p>The Signal Corps has purchased many samples of
field glasses from various manufacturers with a view
of testing their suitability for the military service.
These samples may be examined by officers of the
army at the signal office in Washington. Among
these samples there are many excellent glasses especially
suitable for the military service, but the higher
grades are too expensive for general issue to line
organizations in large quantities. Officers desiring
an especially fine field glass should inspect the samples
referred to; these, however, are not for sale by
the Government, but information will be supplied
concerning dealers and cost.</p>

<p>No advice or fixed rule can be stated as to what constitutes
the most suitable characteristics of a field
glass. No single field glass can furnish maximum
results under all conditions on account of varying
conditions of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>A high-power glass is unsuitable for use at night,
hazy atmosphere, or for use of a mounted man where
the glass can not be rested against a firm support. A
low-power glass with large object lens to permit as
much light as possible is a necessary condition for use
at night. The double power glass which is issued as a
part of the visual signaling outfits was designed for
the military service as a compromise for conflicting
conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>A brief description of the field glasses issued by the
Signal Corps, together with the cost of the same, is
given below.</p>

<p>Type A:</p>

<p>This glass is the current result of the efforts of the
Signal Corps to provide a field glass that will meet
the greatest variety of conditions, and insure efficient
service to the greatest number of military observers.
It is really two glasses in one&mdash;a <i>day</i> glass of medium
power, and a <i>night</i> glass of low power.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 509px;"><a id="Figure_31"></a>
<img src="images/i_126.jpg" width="509" height="359" alt="photograph" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>&mdash;Type A. Showing the field glass and case with sling cord, shoulder
straps, belt loops, and compass</div>
</div>

<p>It is to be clearly understood that while this glass
is considered superior for moderate ranges, it does not
replace, under special conditions, for long ranges,
either the porro prism glass or the telescope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>When held as shown in <a href="#Figure_32">figure 32</a> with the tubes
drawn out about 1 inch to secure proper focus, the
glass has a power of about 5.6 diameters, and a field
of about 5.4 degrees.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;"><a id="Figure_32"></a>
<img src="images/i_127.jpg" width="520" height="385" alt="photograph" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32</span>&mdash;Signal Corps field glass, Type A.</div>
</div>

<p>If the glass is turned into the position shown in figure
33, the small plus lenses, just in front of the eye
pieces, drop automatically into position and reduce
the power to 3.8 diameters, and increase the field to
8.3 degrees. This position requires a different adjustment,
the tubes being drawn out about one-third of
an inch to get the proper focus. It will be observed
in the illustrations that the rear bar of the frame is
not only lettered to indicate which power is being
used, but the bar itself is shaped with a hump on one
side, and hollowed on the other. When the hump is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
up, the low power is in use. This is to facilitate
adjustment in the dark.</p>

<p>The action of the small automatic lenses is free and
positive. <i>Neither the eyepieces nor the sections containing
the small lenses should be unscrewed, except in case
of necessity, and then not by unskilled hands.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 512px;"><a id="Figure_33"></a>
<img src="images/i_128.jpg" width="512" height="345" alt="photograph, yes the same as the one before except the cord if lying differently" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span>&mdash;Signal Corps field glass, Type A.</div>
</div>

<p>The frame, of aluminum and brass, is composite,
to give lightness and strength; and while it is constructed
to withstand the rough handling of field service,
no field glass is proof against careless or wanton
treatment. The tubes are covered with tan leather,
and a round sling cord, braided from four strands of
pliable tan leather, is fastened by snaps to eyes in the
frame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The case is of tan calfskin, provided with shoulder
strap, and has an efficient small compass set into the
cover. Two loops are sewed to the back of the case
so that it may be worn on a belt.</p>

<p>The glass, complete with case, cord, and straps,
weighs 21.5 ounces.</p>

<p>Two of these glasses are issued to each company of
infantry and coast artillery, Philippine Scouts, and
Signal Corps, and to each troop of cavalry for use in
instruction in visual signaling. Below is a brief
description of the type A glass.</p>

<p>Magnification, 3&frac12; and 5&frac12; diameters; Galilean type;
object lens, 1&frac12; inches; tan leather finish; tan leather
carrying case with compass; weight of glass, complete,
with case, cord, and strap, 25 ounces. At a distance
of 1,000 yards the field of view includes a diameter of
123 yards for the 3&frac12; power, and 73 yards for the 5&frac12;
power. Length of glass closed, 4 inches. This glass
is issued as a part of the visual signaling kit to each
company of infantry, coast artillery, and Philippine
Scouts, troop of cavalry, machine-gun platoon, and
Signal Corps field company. Price, $12.15.</p>

<p>The latest issue of this glass known as the Type
A, model 1910, includes provision for interpupillary
adjustment, the two barrels being hinged to accommodate
the glass to the distance between the pupils of
the eye. The price of the model 1910 glass is $14.75.</p>

<p>Type B:</p>

<p>This field glass is similar in appearance and construction
to the Type A glass, and is issued to the
field artillery organizations upon requisition. The
following is a brief description:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Magnification, 4&frac12; and 6&frac12; diameters; Galilean type;
object lens, 1&frac34; inches; interpupillary adjustment; tan
leather finish; tan leather carrying case with compass;
weight of glass, complete, with case, cord, and straps,
26 ounces; length of glass closed, 4&frac12; inches. At a
distance of 1,000 yards the field of view includes a
diameter of 90 yards for the 4&frac12; power, and 60 yards
for the 6&frac12; power. This glass is issued as a part of the
fire-control equipment to field artillery. Price, $17.50.</p>

<p>Type C:</p>

<p>The type C is a high power glass of the porro prism
type and is issued only to certain organizations of the
field artillery, Signal Corps, and to all machine-gun
platoons.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Magnification, 10 diameters; prismatic
type; object lens, 1&frac34; inches; interpupillary
adjustment; tan leather finish; sunshade; tan leather
carrying case; weight of glass, complete, with case,
cord, and straps, 46 ounces; length of glass closed,
7&frac34; inches. At a distance of 1,000 yards the field of
view includes a diameter of 80 yards. This glass is
issued to reconnaissance officers of field artillery.
Price, $39.90.</p>

<p>Type D: Purchase has been made for delivery in
the near future of a supply of a new type of high
power prismatic field glass for sale and issue. This
new type of glass, to be known as type D, is considerably
smaller than the type C glass, as is shown by
<a href="#Figure_34">figure 34</a>. The glass in a tan-colored carrying case
weighs 15 ounces, the field glass without the case
weighing but 9 ounces. The magnification is 8
powers and the field of view (with both eyes) 5&deg; 40&prime;.
The estimated cost will be $27.</p>

<h3>GENERAL SPECIFICATION NO. 263.</h3>

<div class="center">[Revised February 10, 1910.]</div>

<h4>SERVICE FIELD GLASSES.</h4>

<p>1. <i>Preliminary.</i>&mdash;This specification covers the design
and construction of field glasses, types A and B,
each having two powers as hereinafter specified.</p>

<p>2. <i>Sample.</i>&mdash;The bidder shall furnish with his proposal
a sample of the glass which he will supply, and
award will be made after comparison of the samples
with models on file in the office of the Chief Signal
Officer. The maker will be allowed to examine the
model glasses in detail in the office of the Chief Signal
Officer of the Army, Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>3. <i>Inspection and test.</i>&mdash;When the order under this
specification is complete, the contractor will notify
the Chief Signal Officer of the Army, who will cause
an inspection to be made. It shall be the duty of the
contractor to remedy any defects pointed out by the
inspector, and the contractor will be held accountable
for any imperfections which the inspector may have
overlooked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Figure_34"></a>
<img src="images/i_132.jpg" width="600" height="376" alt="photograph" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span>&mdash;Field glasses, Types C and D.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chief Signal Officer of the Army reserves the
right to inspect any or all processes of manufacture,
and unsatisfactory material will be marked for rejection
by the inspector before, during, or after assembly,
as occasion may arise.</p>

<p>Each glass will be tested for power, field, definition,
and light. Any glass which is not the equal of the
sample and model in all respects will be rejected.
The properties above enumerated will be tested as
follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Power: In testing for power the glass will be
placed upon a firm support about the height of the
eye and directed upon a range rod, accurately divided
into divisions of 1 foot, with alternate divisions
colored red and white, respectively. The rod should
be placed approximately 100 feet from the glass in a
good light and with strongly contrasted background.</p>

<p>The rod is observed through the glass with one eye
and at the same time with the other eye unaided. An
accurate comparison of the two images by means of
the rod scale determines the magnifying power of the
glass.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Field: The field will be determined by the use
of a transit or any other instrument adapted to the
measurement of horizontal angles. The glass will be
placed upon the telescope of the transit in such a way
that the axes of collimation of the telescope and
field glass barrels are parallel. The extreme limits of
the field of view of the glass are marked in a convenient
way and the horizontal angle of view accurately
measured with the transit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Definition: In determining the definition of the
glass expressed in units (seconds) a target will be provided
with a number of lines one-tenth inch thick
with one-tenth inch spaces between them drawn on
a piece of heavy white paper.</p>

<p>At a certain distance this target will appear uniformly
gray when viewed through the glass.</p>

<p>The inspector will gradually approach the target,
focusing the glass until he reaches the most distant
point from the target where the uniform field ceases
and the black and white intervals appear distinct and
defined.</p>

<p>Assume the distance thus found to be 20 yards and
the thickness of the lines and intervals between them
one-tenth inch. The circumference of a circle with a
radius of 20 yards or 7,200 tenths inches is 14,400 by
3.1416, or 45,240 tenths inches; but a circumference
equals 360&deg;, or (360 by 60 by 60) 1,296,000 seconds.</p>

<p>If, therefore, 45,240 tenths inches correspond to
1,296,000 seconds, then one-tenth inch equals 1,296,000
divided by 45,240, or 28.6 seconds. The definition is
therefore 28.6 seconds, or practically half a minute.</p>

<p>The definition should be as follows:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="field glasses">
<tr><td align="left">For 6.5 power glass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left">30 seconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">For 5.5 power glass</td><td align="left">35 seconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">For 4.5 power glass</td><td align="left">40 seconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">For 3.5 power glass</td><td align="left">55 seconds.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Light: The light of a field glass is expressed by
a number which is the ratio of the amount of light
which reaches the eye through the glass to the amount
which enters the eye unaided. This comparison will
be reached by means of the absorption apparatus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
furnished by the Signal Corps. This apparatus consists
of two wedge-shaped vessels made of brass with
glass windows in the sides, and are filled with a perfectly
black liquid. The sky line is first viewed
through the apparatus with the naked eye and the
instrument adjusted to limit of visibility. The reading
of the scale is then noted. The sky line is again
observed, using the glass, but in other respects as
before, and a second scale reading obtained. The ratio
of these readings measure the illuminating power of the
glass which must conform to the standard sample.</p>

<p>4. <i>Service field glass, type A.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) This glass shall
conform in general to the model, now on file in the
office of the Chief Signal Officer at Washington. The
arrangement for changing automatically from the low
power to the high power, and vice versa, by the interposition
of the plus lens at the proper distance in front
of the eyepiece, must be strictly adhered to.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The <i>low power</i> shall be approximately 3&frac12; diameters
and the <i>high power</i> shall be approximately 5&frac12;
diameters. The figure of merit given by multiplying
the numbers of diameters power by the number of
degrees of field will be considered in the examination
of samples, along with the other properties of light,
sharpness of definition, and general excellence.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The tubes, frame, and metal fittings</i> shall be of
aluminum or an aluminum alloy, with the exception
that such metal parts as in the opinion of the maker
require greater strength may be made of brass.</p>

<p>Tubes shall be held firmly in the frame, single draw,
the draw action to be through a bearing surface of at
least five-eighths of an inch of best black felt, perfectly
fitted so as to preserve perfect alignment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>The exterior metal parts, except where leather
covered, must be given the best and most durable,
lusterless black finish. The tubes and shades will be
neatly covered with best quality tanned calfskin, the
leather to be sewed on, and the seams to lie flat next
to the focusing standard.</p>

<p>The interior of all parts to be painted a perfectly
dead black.</p>

<p>The sunshades, when drawn out, shall project at
least five-eighths of an inch and not over 1 inch
beyond the edge of the cell.</p>

<p>The focusing screw and standard should follow
closely that of the sample, except that the milled
focusing disk should have a face as nearly one-half
inch wide as possible and the milling should be
sharper.</p>

<p>In addition to the diaphragm upon which the automatic
lens is mounted, there shall be two diaphragms
in each tube, so situated and so proportioned as to cut
off all stray light and all internal reflections.</p>

<p>The crossbar supporting the draw tubes should be
shaped and engraved exactly as found in the model.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The lenses must be entirely free from mechanical
defects, such as specks, air bubbles, etc.; must be
free from interior strain, and must be ground from the
best obtainable glass for the purpose, selected for
general transparency, as colorless as possible, perfectly
ground and polished, and accurately centered.</p>

<p><i>The object lenses</i> shall be composite, achromatic,
and well corrected for spherical aberration, with a
clear aperture of at least 1&frac12; inches, and not exceeding
1<small><sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub></small> inches. Bidders will state the number and shape
of the pieces used to make up this lens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The compound lenses</i> may be either cemented
together with Canada balsam, or left uncemented, as
the maker may deem best for durability and optical
performance, but if left uncemented the components
shall have a permanent mark to indicate their proper
positions in the cell.</p>

<p><i>The eyepieces</i> shall consist of a single double concave
lens having a clear aperture of not less than three-eighths
of an inch and not more than one-half of an
inch.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The sling cord attached to eyes in the frame by
means of brass snaps with black burned finish shall
be round and braided from four strands of pliable tan
leather, and shall have a diameter of at least one-eighth
of an inch and not over one-sixth of an inch.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>The case and strap</i> must be exactly like sample,
and of No. 1 stock. Care must be taken to put in only
compasses that are in perfect condition. The strap
buckle must be of brass. The glass, when closed,
must not exceed 4 inches in length, and the glass, case,
cord, and strap, complete, must not exceed 25 ounces
in weight.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) The frame shall be constructed with jointed
bars for interpupillary adjustment.</p>

<p>5. <i>Service field glass, type B.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) The requirements
of part 4, service field glass, type A, of this specification,
shall be followed in the design and construction
of the type B glass in so far as applicable.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Power: The lower power shall be approximately
4&frac12; and the high 6&frac12; diameters.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Object lenses: These shall have a clear aperture
of at least 1&frac34; inches diameter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Case: Case and carrying strap shall be furnished
as required in part 4 of this specification.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) This glass shall be constructed with jointed bars
for interpupillary adjustment.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) The sunshade, when drawn out, shall project
not less than three-eighths of an inch and not more
than 1 inch beyond the edge of the cell.</p>

<p>6. <i>Marking.</i>&mdash;Glasses furnished under this specification
shall be marked on one barrel with the words
"Signal Corps, U. S. Army," and on the other barrel
"Serial No. &mdash;&mdash;." Serial numbers will be furnished
with the order. If not furnished the contractor at
the time the order is placed, the Disbursing Officer
of the Signal Corps should be called upon for same,
and the numbers and other marking placed on the
glasses prior to the delivery of the order.</p>
